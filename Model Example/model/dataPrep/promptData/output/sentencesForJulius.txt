*/sample513 THIS IS NO SURPRISING TRAIT FOR A BALLPLAYER
*/sample514 YOU'RE AFRAID TO TALK TO A GUY YOU IDOLIZE
*/sample515 LITTLE GEEING AND HAWING HAVE BEEN NECESSARY
*/sample516 SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATED THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS REVENGE ON HIS HOME TOWN

*/sample527 THE BOOST IS HELPFUL BUT INADEQUATE
*/sample528 THEREUPON FOLLOWED A DEMONSTRATION THAT TYRANNY KNOWS NO IDEOLOGICAL CONFINES
*/sample529 WOODED STREAM VALLEYS IN THE FOLDS OF EARTH WOULD BE SAVED
*/sample530 HIS ELECTION ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY STRENGTHEN THE REGULARS

*/sample561 THIS IS GOING TO BE A LANGUAGE LESSON AND YOU CAN MASTER IT IN A FEW MINUTES

*/sample599 WHAT EXPLAINS THIS UNI-DIRECTIONAL PARALYSIS
*/sample600 ORIGINALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOOD AND ADAPTATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD
*/sample601 BUT THAT EXPLANATION IS ONLY PARTLY TRUE
*/sample602 BUT THE SHIPS ARE VERY SLOW NOW AND WE DON'T GET SO MANY SAILORS ANY MORE
*/sample603 MELANCHOLY OBSESSION
*/sample604 THEY WERE SHOWN HOW TO ADVANCE AGAINST AN ENEMY OUTPOST ATOP A CLEARED RIDGE
*/sample605 WE WOULD LOSE OUR EXPORT MARKETS AND DENY OURSELVES THE IMPORTS WE NEED
*/sample606 WITH THIS NO LOYAL CITIZEN CAN QUARREL
*/sample607 MERCENARY TERM OF HONOR
*/sample608 THIS POSSIBILITY IS ANYTHING BUT REASSURING
*/sample609 THE PUBLIC IS NOW ARMED WITH SOPHISTICATION AND NUMEROUS COMPETING MEDIA
*/sample610 BUT THE ATTACK WAS MADE FROM AN ADVANCE COPY
*/sample611 WELL NOW WE HAVE TWO BIG THEATERS
*/sample612 SPLENDOR BY SORCERY IT'S A HORROR
*/sample613 ONE-UPMANSHIP IS PRACTICED BY BOTH SIDES IN A TOTAL WAR
*/sample614 THIS BIG FLEXIBLE VOICE WITH UNCOMMON RANGE HAS BEEN SUPERBLY DISCIPLINED
*/sample615 HER DEBUT OVER PERHAPS THE EARLIER SCENES WILL EMERGE EQUALLY FINE
*/sample616 HE INJECTED MORE VITALITY INTO THE SCORE THAN IT HAS REVEALED IN MANY YEARS
*/sample617 THE STORYLINE IN SORT IS WILDLY UNREALISTIC
*/sample618 HE TALKED ABOUT UNAUTHENTIC STORYLINES TOO
*/sample619 HE PRAISES MANY INDIVIDUALS GENEROUSLY
*/sample620 HIS PORTRAYAL OF AN EDGY HEAD-IN-THE-CLOUDS ARTIST IS VIRTUALLY FLAWLESS
*/sample621 NOT A CORNER HAS BEEN VISIBLY CUT IN THIS ONE
*/sample622 THE MASTER'S HAND HAS LOST NONE OF ITS CRAFT
*/sample623 HE SHOWED PUNY MEN ATTACKED BY SPLENDIDLY TYRANNICAL MACHINES
*/sample624 HE MAY HAVE A POINT IN URGING THAT DECADENT THEMES BE GIVEN FEWER PRIZES
*/sample625 A TINY HANDFUL NEVER DID MAKE THE CONCERT
*/sample626 THE WORKS ARE PRESENTED CHRONOLOGICALLY
*/sample627 THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION CAN BE IMAGINED
*/sample628 IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
*/sample629 HIS TECHNIQUE IS AMPLE AND HIS MUSICAL IDEAS ARE PROJECTED BEAUTIFULLY
*/sample630 WHAT A DISCUSSION CAN ENSUE WHEN THE TITLE OF THIS TYPE OF SONG IS IN QUESTION
*/sample631 PROGRAM NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS TAKE HANDS THIS URGENT VISAGE BECKONS US
*/sample632 THE ORCHESTRA WAS OBVIOUSLY ON ITS METTLE AND IT PLAYED MOST RESPONSIVELY
*/sample633 HE LIKED TO NIP EAR LOBES OF UNSUSPECTING VISITORS WITH HIS NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH
*/sample634 HERE HE IS QUITE PERSUASIVELY THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF MEANNESS AND SLYNESS
*/sample635 HE IS A MAN OF MAJOR TALENT  BUT A MAN OF SOLITARY UNCERTAIN IMPULSES
*/sample636 HE WAS ABOVE ALL A FRIEND SEEKER ALMOST PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO BE LIKED
*/sample637 HE ENLISTED A STAFF OF LOYAL EXPERTS AND OF MANY ZEALOUS VOLUNTEERS
*/sample638 THIS THEORY EVENTUALLY PROVED INEXACT
*/sample639 THE HEAVENS REFUSED TO GIVE UP THEIR WEEPING
*/sample640 BUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS CREEPING MANNERISM
*/sample641 CLEVER LIGHT SONGS WERE OVERLY COY TRAGIC SONGS A LITTLE TOO MELODRAMATIC
*/sample642 THEIR PROPS WERE TWO STEPLADDERS A CHAIR AND A PALM FAN
*/sample643 THE ARMCHAIR TRAVELER PRESERVES HIS ILLUSIONS
*/sample644 ALL ARE WELL WRITTEN AND ARE OVERWRITTEN
*/sample645 HE IGNORES GUIDEBOOK FACTS
*/sample646 NICE EVEN IF A TRIFLE GAUDY
*/sample647 BELOW IS A SPECIFIC GUIDE KEYED TO THE CALENDAR
*/sample648 A SAILBOAT MAY HAVE A BONE IN HER TEETH ONE MINUTE AND LIE BECALMED THE NEXT
*/sample649 IT SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF UNITY OF PURPOSE AND RESPECT FOR HEROIC LEADERSHIP
*/sample650 THE FAT MAN HAS TROUBLE BUYING LIFE INSURANCE OR HAS TO PAY HIGHER PREMIUMS
*/sample651 FAR MORE FREQUENTLY OVEREATING IS THE RESULT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPULSION
*/sample652 JUST WHAT IS MEANT BY SPIRIT AND BY MATTER
*/sample653 SURELY THIS IS A REALITY WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE
*/sample654 YET IT EXISTS AND HAS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY WHICH CAN BE EXPERIENCED AND KNOWN
*/sample655 YET THE SPIRIT WHICH LIVES IN COMMUNITY IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH THE COMMUNITY
*/sample656 BUT THIS STATEMENT IS COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING
*/sample657 A SECOND POINT REQUIRES MORE EXTENDED COMMENT
*/sample658 THE STRAIGHT LINE WOULD SYMBOLIZE ITS UNIQUENESS THE CIRCLE ITS UNIVERSALITY
*/sample659 HIS HISTORY IS HIS ALONE YET EACH MAN MUST RECOGNIZE HIS OWN HISTORY IN IT
*/sample660 HISTORICAL EXISTENCE IS A CREATED GOOD
*/sample661 DEATH REMINDS MAN OF HIS SIN BUT IT REMINDS HIM ALSO OF HIS TRANSIENCE
*/sample662 SUCH A CALM AND ASSURING PEACE CAN BE YOURS
*/sample663 SATELLITES SPUTNIKS ROCKETS BALLOONS WHAT NEXT
*/sample664 LOOK AT THE THINGS WE DO TO ESCAPE OUR FEARS AND TO FORGET OUR WORRIES
*/sample665 MEANWHILE THE ENEMY WILL CAPITALIZE ON OUR FEARS IF HE CAN
*/sample666 OUR ENEMY IS ALSO THREATENING TO DEVOUR US
*/sample667 YES INDEED WE TOO CAN SEE A WARLIKE HOST OF INFIDELS ENCAMPED AGAINST US
*/sample668 WE ARE ALL INVOLVED IN THEM DEEPLY INVOLVED
*/sample669 LATER WE SHALL SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AN EMPEROR TOOK THIS IDEA TOO LITERALLY
*/sample670 NEGLECT MEANS SPIRITUAL PARALYSIS OR DEATH
*/sample671 A HELPFUL LEAFLET MAY BE ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER
*/sample672 NONE SHOULD ASK LESS
*/sample673 PSYCHOLOGICALLY THE RECEPTION SHOULD BE THE CLIMAX FOLLOWING THE SERMON
*/sample674 THIS IS NO SPECTATOR-TYPE EXPERIENCE EVERYONE IS TO BE A PARTICIPANT
*/sample675 BOTH EVENTUALITIES ARE POSSIBLE LOGICALLY BUT PRACTICALLY THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE
*/sample676 THEOCRACY RECONSIDERED
*/sample677 COMPARABLE TRENDS CAN BE NOTED ELSEWHERE
*/sample678 SALVATION RECONSIDERED
*/sample679 HE IS NOT TALKING IN THE MAIN ABOUT PROBABILITIES RISKS AND DANGER IN GENERAL
*/sample680 NO POLITICAL ORDER OR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS SO CLEARLY CONTRARY TO NATURE
*/sample681 WOULD SUCH AN ACT OF REFUSAL BE USEFUL
*/sample682 OFTEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IN ONLY BECAUSE THE AREA IS DECLINING ECONOMICALLY
*/sample683 AN OCTILLION ATOMS  NOW LET US SEE WHERE THIS POWER COMES FROM
*/sample684 THIS IS THE ATOMIC SUN THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS
*/sample685 AT ANY RATE IT SHOWS US HOW IMMATERIAL WE ARE
*/sample686 OTHERS WERE EPHEMERAL
*/sample687 THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT TOOK MANY FORMS
*/sample688 THE DEAD SPIRITS OCCUPIED A PROMINENT PLACE IN EVERY HOPE AND IN EVERY FEAR
*/sample689 MEN BELIEVED THEY COULD CONTROL NATURE BY OBEYING A MORAL CODE
*/sample690 PROPRIETY WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH RITUAL OBSERVANCE THE MARK OF A TRUE GENTLEMAN
*/sample691 BUT THIS ESOTERIC DOCTRINE WAS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE TO ACQUIRE SPECIAL POWERS
*/sample692 WHY SAID THE TEACHER ART THOU SO LATE
*/sample693 HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE ABIDES IN DEATH
*/sample694 THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS AND MYSTERIOUS
*/sample695 THE NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS
*/sample696 SOME HAVE WALKED THROUGH PAIN AND SORROW TO BRING YOU THEIR MESSAGE OF HOPE
*/sample697 BUT FROM THE START THEY HAD TWO IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS SINCERITY AND REALISM
*/sample698 THE CRISIS LATER ON WHEN DEBTS SEEMED ABOUT TO OVERWHELM ME
*/sample699 YOU'RE NOT LIVING UP TO YOUR OWN PRINCIPLES SHE TOLD MY DISCOURAGED PEOPLE
*/sample700 YOU'RE SO PREOCCUPIED THAT YOU'VE LET YOUR FAITH GROW DIM
*/sample701 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO ASSURE MY CONTINUED EXISTENCE
*/sample702 WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE POWER OF FAITH AT WORK AMONG US
*/sample703 IT WAS MUSCULAR BUT IT WASN'T SYMMETRICAL
*/sample704 OH YOU'LL WOBBLE AND WEAVE QUITE A BIT AT FIRST
*/sample705 ANTS CARRY AWAY THE SEEDS SO BETTER BE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO ANT HILLS NEARBY
*/sample706 PANSIES ARE GLUTTONS
*/sample707 THE AVOCADO SHOULD HAVE A GIVE TO IT AS YOU HOLD IT WHEN IT IS RIPE
*/sample708 THERE IS NO DYEING OR WAXING OR GASSING NEEDED
*/sample709 AVOCADOS HOWEVER ARE VERY RICH IN NUTRIENTS
*/sample710 HOWEVER THE AIRCRAFT WHICH WE HAVE TODAY ARE TIED TO LARGE SOFT AIRFIELDS
*/sample711 NUCLEAR ROCKETS CAN DESTROY AIRFIELDS WITH EASE
*/sample712 OUR FIRST NECESSITY AT THE VERY OUTSET OF WAR IS POST-ATTACK RECONNAISSANCE
*/sample713 WHAT TARGETS HAVE WE SUCCESSFULLY KNOCKED OUT
*/sample714 OTHER INTERPRETATIONS PRESENT THE MUSIC AS AN ESSENTIALLY INTIMATE CREATION
*/sample715 FOR ME IT HAS MORE OF BOTH ELEMENTS THAN THE MAJORITY OF ITS COMPETITORS
*/sample716 THERE ARE CANOES IDEAL FOR FISHING IN PROTECTED WATERS OR FOR CAMPING TRIPS
*/sample717 NOW HERE IS TRULY A MARVEL
*/sample718 STATE NUMBERING LAWS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN MANY WAYS
*/sample719 INDUSTRY INTEREST IN SAFETY GOES EVEN FARTHER
*/sample720 FILE TO A SMOOTH FINISH
*/sample721 THIS TOOL CAN ALSO BE MADE WITH A LATHE
*/sample722 THIS CHANGES THE FORMULA TO AN EQUATION
*/sample723 THE TOTAL OF THESE THREE VOLUMES IS THE FINAL COMBUSTION CHAMBER VOLUME
*/sample724 IT'S A STREAMLINED RIFLE FAST AND WELL-MADE
*/sample725 A SPRING TRAP FOR SOLID MOUNTING AND A REGULAR HAND TRAP ARE ALSO AVAILABLE

*/sample727 THEN SIMMER FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER
*/sample728 POACH THE APPLES IN THIS SYRUP FOR TWELVE MINUTES DRAIN THEM AND COOL
*/sample729 BEST SOLUTION IS TO FIND AN AREA THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY SUNLIGHT OR SHADE
*/sample730 ANOTHER MEMO FOR SIGHTSEERS BRING YOUR CAMERA ALONG TO MUSEUMS
*/sample731 A FEW YEARS LATER THE DOME FELL IN
*/sample732 DO LINE BARBECUE FIRE BOWL WITH HEAVY FOIL TO REFLECT HEAT

*/sample787 FEED PRESSURE IS ALSO OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE
*/sample788 WE HAVE BECOME AMATEUR INSURANCE EXPERTS AND FINE-FEATHERED YARD BIRDS
*/sample789 BUT PROBLEMS CLING TO POOLS AS ANY POOL OWNER KNOWS
*/sample790 WE SEEMED TO BE WITNESSING THE POPULATION EXPLOSION RIGHT IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS
*/sample791 SO RULES WE MADE IN UNABASHED COLLUSION
*/sample792 BUT FENCED OR UNFENCED NO POOL-SIDE IS THE PLACE FOR RUNNING OR HORSEPLAY
*/sample793 A POOL IS NO PLACE FOR A SHUT TRAP
*/sample794 YOU SHOULD FIRMLY INSIST THAT NO BOBBY PINS OR HAIR PINS BE WORN IN THE WATER
*/sample795 WHEN SHED THEY LEAVE RUST MARKS
*/sample796 THE FILTERED AIR BENEFITS ALLERGIES ASTHMA SINUS HAY FEVER

*/sample799 THAT BRINGS ITS PER-YEAR COST DOWN MIGHTY LOW
*/sample800 THE SIMPLEST KIND OF SEPARATE SYSTEM USES A SINGLE SELF-CONTAINED UNIT

*/sample804 THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN SITE SELECTION
*/sample805 BEGIN THE EXAMINATION OF A SITE WITH A GOOD MAP AND AERIAL PHOTOS IF POSSIBLE
*/sample806 YOU NEED ANSWERS TO FOUR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
*/sample807 ONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE FEATURES FOR A PARK ARE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OR SCENERY
*/sample808 A SITE MAY ALSO BE ATTRACTIVE JUST THROUGH THE BEAUTY OF ITS TREES AND SHRUBS

*/sample955 WORSE HIS PRESENT CREW INCLUDED FIVE MEN WHO HAD SAILED WITH HIM BEFORE
*/sample956 TURBULENT TIDES ROSE AS MUCH AS FIFTY FEET

*/sample1018 CATTLE WHICH DIED FROM THEM WINTER STORMS WERE REFERRED TO AS THE WINTER KILL

*/sample1020 THE COWBOY CALLED THIS BREED OF CATTLE MAGPIES
*/sample1021 THE COWBOY'S HUMOROUS NAME FOR A COW GIVIN' MILK WAS A MILK PITCHER

*/sample1029 HER TAIL NO LONGER LASHED
*/sample1030 BRING ME THE FIRECRACKERS
*/sample1031 AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY THOUGH
*/sample1032 IT WAS THE STORY OF THE RHINOCEROS FIGHT ALL OVER AGAIN
*/sample1033 IF DARK CAME THEY WOULD LOSE HER
*/sample1034 SHE SNARLED WARNINGLY
*/sample1035 WITH A WHIRLING JUMP IT COULD GET INTO GEAR
*/sample1036 THE ANTITHESIS OF THE ECUMENICAL AND THE LOCAL THEN NO LONGER EXISTS
*/sample1037 THE REVISED PROCEDURE WAS ACCLAIMED AS A LONG-OVERDUE REFORM
*/sample1038 THE COURTYARD IS MAGNIFICENTLY DECORATED
*/sample1039 HE HAS NEVER HIMSELF DONE ANYTHING FOR WHICH TO BE HATED  WHICH OF US HAS
*/sample1040 NORTHERNERS INDULGE IN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS LUXURY
*/sample1041 BRIEF SNIPS OF ACTUAL EVENTS WERE SHOWN PARADES DANCES STREET SCENES
*/sample1042 TIME AND SPACE HAVE BOTH BECOME CINEMATIC
*/sample1043 NOT SURPRISINGLY THIS APPROACH DID NOT WORK
*/sample1044 RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATIONS STRUGGLE TO INSULATE THEMSELVES AGAINST INTRUSIONS
*/sample1045 IT OFFERED TO SURRENDER ITS RIGHT TO EXCLUSIVE TRADE BUT ASKED AN INDEMNITY
*/sample1046 THESE MEN WERE WITHOUT CAPITAL OR EXPERIENCE
*/sample1047 TWENTY-FIVE THE SHEIK REPLIED
*/sample1048 THE LIBRARY HAS OPEN SHELVES EVEN IN THE UNBOUND PERIODICAL STOCKROOM
*/sample1049 THEY UNDERSTOOD AND TEASED ME A BIT ABOUT IT
*/sample1050 BOTH THE CONDITIONS AND THE COMPLICITY ARE DOCUMENTED IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL
*/sample1051 NORTHERN LIBERALS ARE THE CHIEF SUPPORTERS OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND OF INTEGRATION
*/sample1052 THE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA
*/sample1053 WHATEVER THEIR FAULTS THEY ARE NOT HYPOCRITES
*/sample1054 A CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS IN PROCESS OF ARTICULATION AND ESTABLISHMENT
*/sample1055 INTERNAL NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY NOW A TRUISM NEED NOT BE DOCUMENTED
*/sample1056 CAN THERMONUCLEAR WAR BE SET OFF BY ACCIDENT
*/sample1057 ARE WE AS SAFE AS WE SHOULD BE FROM SUCH A DISASTER
*/sample1058 READINESS EXERCISES ARE ALMOST CONTINUOUS
*/sample1059 THEY KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEIR MACHINERY BEYOND MECHANICAL DETAILS
*/sample1060 THEY INHABIT A SECRET WORLD CENTERED ON GO CODES AND GOLD PHONES
*/sample1061 BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY DECIDES TO BREAK IT
*/sample1062 VITAL QUESTIONS WOULD BE QUICKLY ANSWERED ACCORDING TO A PREPREPARED AGENDA
*/sample1063 NO QUESTION RUFFLES HIM OR CAUSES HIM TO HESITATE
*/sample1064 UNLESS WE SEND OUT THE WHOLE PIE THEIR PIECES MEAN NOTHING
*/sample1065 ALL THREE MUST COMPARE NOTES AND AGREE TO GO
*/sample1066 THEY WERE CHASING A RAIN CLOUD
*/sample1067 THEIR GAIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY IN WORDS
*/sample1068 ANY ORGANISM THAT FALTERS OR MISPERCEIVES THE SIGNALS OR WEAKENS IS DONE
*/sample1069 PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT GIVES THE ABORIGINE HIS ODD AIR OF DIGNITY
*/sample1070 DO YOU ALWAYS NAVIGATE LIKE THIS
*/sample1071 TWO MILES NORTHEAST THEN FIVE MILES SOUTHWEST  THAT SORT OF THING
*/sample1072 THERE WAS ALSO A DOG A DINGO DOG
*/sample1073 THEY'LL MOVE AROUND THAT ROCK ALL DAY FOLLOWING THE SHADE
*/sample1074 HE GAZED AWAY FROM US AS WE APPROACHED
*/sample1075 THERE WAS ALSO A BOOMERANG ELABORATELY CARVED
*/sample1076 THE TINY BODIES DROPPED ONTO A DRY LEAF MADE A PILE AS BIG AS A SMALL APPLE
*/sample1077 THE ODOR HERE WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT WHICH SURROUNDED THE TOWN ABORIGINES
*/sample1078 THE SMELL IS SEXUAL BUT SO POWERFULLY SO THAT A CIVILIZED NOSE MUST DENY IT
*/sample1079 BOYS AND MEN GO ALONG THE RIVERBANK OR TO THE ALCOVES IN THE TOP ARCADE
*/sample1080 WHEN HE WAS EIGHT HE BEGAN VIOLIN LESSONS
*/sample1081 OUR SUCCESSORS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TASK
*/sample1082 A NEW ORDER IS THRUSTING ITSELF INTO BEING
*/sample1083 THE SYSTEM WORKS AS AN IMPERSONAL MECHANISM
*/sample1084 THE THEME MAY BE THE FORMATION OF A SHAPE FROM WHICH OTHER SHAPES EVOLVE
*/sample1085 HE MAY TOSS COINS HE MAY TAKE SLIPS OF PAPER FROM A GRAB BAG
*/sample1086 THEN THE CHOREOGRAPHER MUST ARBITRATE
*/sample1087 HE MUST REARRANGE MATTERS SO THAT TWO PERFORMERS DO NOT BUMP INTO EACH OTHER
*/sample1088 ONE WONDERS ABOUT ITS APPLICABILITY TO PEOPLE
*/sample1089 PERHAPS THINGS WERE EVEN WORSE THEN
*/sample1090 BUT A SOMEWHAT MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS PROCESS MAY BE ILLUMINATING
*/sample1091 SOLAR ACTIVITIES COULD PRESUMABLY BRING LONG PERIODS OF FLOOD OR DROUGHT
*/sample1092 YET WE NO LONGER FEEL UNEASY
*/sample1093 WHAT ELEMENTS OF OUR BEHAVIOR ARE DECISIVE
*/sample1094 AMERICAN NEWSPAPER REVIEWERS LIKE TO CALL HIS PLAYS NIHILISTIC
*/sample1095 THEY FIND DEEP PESSIMISM IN THEM
*/sample1096 HE WORE A BROWN KNIT SPORTS SHIRT WITH NO TIE
*/sample1097 HIS TALK TURNS TO WHAT HE CALLS THE MESS OR SOMETIMES THIS BUZZING CONFUSION
*/sample1098 ONE CAN ONLY SPEAK OF WHAT IS IN FRONT OF HIM AND THAT NOW IS SIMPLY THE MESS
*/sample1099 THIS DOES NOT ALLOW THE MYSTERY TO INVADE US
*/sample1100 AS SHE GOES SHE HERSELF WILL BE ILLUMINATED
*/sample1101 THEN HE THOUGHT ME MORE PERVERSE THAN EVER
*/sample1102 THE BEATNIKS CRAVE A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE IN WHICH THEIR WHOLE BEING PARTICIPATES
*/sample1103 THEIR WORK MIRRORS THE MENTALITY OF THE PSYCHOPATH ROOTLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE
*/sample1104 THIS GIRL SOON DROPS THE BOURGEOIS PSYCHIATRIST WHO DISAPPROVES OF HER LIFE
*/sample1105 WHAT OBSESSIONS HAD SHE PICKED UP DURING THESE LONG NIGHTS OF TALK
*/sample1106 EVERYTHING IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS REDUCED ITSELF TO SEXUAL SYMBOLISM
*/sample1107 WHAT ONE ACTUALLY REMEMBERS IS ITS GREENNESS
*/sample1108 ONE LOOKED DOWN ON A SEA OF LEAVES A BREAKING WAVE OF FLOWER
*/sample1109 A WHEEL SQUEAKED ON A HUB WAS STILL AND SQUEAKED AGAIN
*/sample1110 THE SEASON BETWEEN SPRING AND SUMMER BELONGS TO LIFE IN ITS CAREFREE ASPECT
*/sample1111 HOW DO WE DEFINE IT
*/sample1112 WHO WILL SAY THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EVEN NOW A HOMOGENEOUS COMMUNITY
*/sample1113 WHETHER HISTORICALLY A FACT OR NOT THE LEGEND HAS A CERTAIN SYMBOLIC VALUE
*/sample1114 WHY SHOULD THIS BE SO
*/sample1115 HE DID NOT HOWEVER SETTLE BACK INTO ACQUIESCENCE WITH THINGS AS THEY WERE
*/sample1116 EACH IS STILL GLORIFIED AS A NATIONAL HERO
*/sample1117 HE FINDS IT IN UTTER MISERY AND DESOLATION
*/sample1118 AS HE HAD LONGED TO BE HE BECAME THE ECHO OF A SAGA
*/sample1119 THE RECORD TEEMS WITH ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE
*/sample1120 HIS TOUGH HONESTY CONDEMNS HIM TO A SOLITARY AND DIFFICULT EXISTENCE
*/sample1121 IN EITHER CASE THEY DO NOT APPRECIATE THE PRIVATE DETECTIVE'S ZEAL
*/sample1122 HIS SUCCESSORS HAVE ADOPTED THE OPPOSITE ALTERNATIVE
*/sample1123 THEY ALSO FURNISH PROOF THAT IN MODERN WAR MESSAGE SENDING MUST BE MONITORED
*/sample1124 LET ME QUOTE HIM EVEN MORE FULLY FOR HIS ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY THEME
*/sample1125 BUT IN EVERY PERIOD IT HAS BEEN HUMANISM
*/sample1126 AND LET ME ADD UTOPIANISM ALSO
*/sample1127 WE OF THE LIBERAL-LED WORLD GOT ALL SET FOR PEACE AND REHABILITATION
*/sample1128 OTHERS INVOKED TECHNOLOGY AND COMMON SENSE
*/sample1129 THIS GROUP IS SECULARIST AND THEIR PROGRAM TENDS TO BE TECHNOLOGICAL
*/sample1130 SHOULD THE ACCELERATING GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY THEN WARN US
*/sample1131 BUT WE CANNOT START OFF WITH A CLEAN SLATE
*/sample1132 NO AMOUNT OF BALLYHOO WILL COVER UP THE SORDID FACTS
*/sample1133 IT CAN PROJECT LONG-RANGE GOALS FOR ITSELF
*/sample1134 INDIVIDUAL HUMAN STRENGTH IS NEEDED TO PIT AGAINST AN INHUMAN CONDITION
*/sample1135 HAVE WE NOT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IDEA WORSHIP
*/sample1136 WE SCOUR LITERATURE FOR THEM HERE WE FIND STORED THE WISDOM OF GREAT MINDS
*/sample1137 HIS NAME BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH COLD-BLOODED CRUELTY
*/sample1138 THAT DOCTRINE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY MANY BUT HAS IT PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS
*/sample1139 IN TIME SHE PRESENTS HER ARISTOCRATIC HUSBAND WITH A COAL-BLACK CHILD
*/sample1140 FALSE IDEAS SURFEIT ANOTHER SECTOR OF OUR LIFE
*/sample1141 THE STEPMOTHER ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS A CRUEL OGRESS
*/sample1142 RESEARCH INTO SEVERAL CULTURES HAS PROVEN HER POSITION TO BE A MISTAKEN ONE
*/sample1143 MOST ASSUREDLY IDEAS ARE INVALUABLE
*/sample1144 WE WOULD ESTABLISH NO CENSORSHIP
*/sample1145 IRONICALLY ENOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE SUCH PERSONAL VIRTUES WERE A LUXURY
*/sample1146 WE KNEW THAT IT WAS AS REASSURANCE THE IRONIC FRUIT OF A DEEPLY MORAL NATURE
*/sample1147 CIVILIZATION IS WHAT MAN HAS MADE OF HIMSELF
*/sample1148 CHANGE INVOLVES THE DISPLACEMENT OF FORM
*/sample1149 THE RESPONSE OF REACTION IS DOMINATED BY A CONCERN FOR WHAT IS VANISHING
*/sample1150 WITH THOSE PAINTINGS OF BIG CONSTRUCTIONS CRASHING DOWN HE FELT HE COULD STOP
*/sample1151 FOR WHAT DO THE UTOPIANS LABOR
*/sample1152 YOU COULD ALSO SAY THAT IN THESE PAMPHLETS IS A RELIEVING QUALITY OF MATURITY
*/sample1153 IN AN IDEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT THE PARTICIPANTS TEND TO THUMP THE TABLE
*/sample1154 ONLY INCOMPLETE IMPERFECT THINGS MOVE TOWARDS WHAT THEY LACK
*/sample1155 HIS PROBLEM CONCERNS LONGITUDES LATITUDES AND ANGULAR VELOCITIES
*/sample1156 THIS IS WHAT NECESSITATES THE NONSYSTEMATIC CHARACTER OF HIS ASTRONOMY
*/sample1157 BUT CONSIDERED WITHIN TECHNICAL ASTRONOMY A DIFFERENT PATTERN CAN BE TRACED
*/sample1158 GEOCENTRICISM PER SE
*/sample1159 CUT OFF EVERY BUILDING AT THE SEVENTH FLOOR
*/sample1160 NEITHER HIS APPETITES HIS EXACERBATIONS NOR HIS DESPAIR WERE KIN TO YOURS
*/sample1161 WITH EACH SONG HE GAVE VERBAL FOOTNOTES
*/sample1162 TWO THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO HIS POPULARITY
*/sample1163 NO MORE STARTLING CONTRAST TO A SYSTEM OF SULLEN SATELLITES COULD BE IMAGINED
*/sample1164 OTHERWISE THE OUTLOOK COULD BE DARK INDEED
*/sample1165 THE CONTINUING MODERNIZATION OF THESE FORCES IS A COSTLY BUT NECESSARY PROCESS
*/sample1166 IN THE COURSE OF ITS INQUIRY IT TOOK TESTIMONY FROM ONLY SEVEN WITNESSES
*/sample1167 WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE UNDER A BUSHEL
*/sample1168 IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SOPHISTICATED THOUGHT TO GET THE IMPACT OF THIS FACT
*/sample1169 THEY DESPISED FOREIGNERS
*/sample1170 HE HAS ALSO AN EXTRAORDINARY CONSCIENCE
*/sample1171 NOR WERE HIS MANNERS BARBARIC
*/sample1172 HE WAS BUSY HE SAID IN HAVING SOMEONE SUBMIT TO A MONKEY-GLAND OPERATION
*/sample1173 HE BROUGHT HER SHAWLS
*/sample1174 IT HAD A TINY ENVELOPE TIED TO ITS WRIST
*/sample1175 DIVERSITY OF PERCEPTION YES DIVERSITY OF FACT YES
*/sample1176 TO SOME EXTENT PREDISPOSITIONS ARE SHAPED BY EXPOSURE TO GROUP ENVIRONMENTS
*/sample1177 IN SOME MEASURE THEY DEPEND UPON THE STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY

*/sample1179 WHAT SHALL THESE EFFECTS BE
*/sample1180 WHAT FACTORS CONDITION THE DEGREE OF REALIZATION AT VARIOUS TIMES AND PLACES
*/sample1181 PROPERLY USED THE PRESENT BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT INSTRUMENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT
*/sample1182 LET US DIFFERENTIATE A FEW OF THESE IDEAS
*/sample1183 IT IS THE OBVERSE OF TRIVIALITY SHALLOWNESS EMOTIONAL ANAESTHESIA
*/sample1184 THERE RESULTS A STUDY OF LITERATURE FREED FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE CONTEMPORARY
*/sample1185 HIS TECHNIQUE IS GENUINELY MASTERFUL
*/sample1186 QUESTIONS CAME TO ME FROM ALL SIDES ABOUT MY WORLD CITIZENSHIP ACTIVITIES
*/sample1187 HE ADVISED IMMEDIATE HOSPITALIZATION
*/sample1188 MAYBE THEY WILL TAKE US
*/sample1189 EIGHT FIELD GUNS WERE CAPTURED IN POSITION
*/sample1190 NEXT BEST TO DESTROYING AN ARMY IS TO DEPRIVE IT OF ITS FREEDOM OF ACTION
*/sample1191 ALL CHANCE OF FULFILLING MY DESTINY IS OVER
*/sample1192 SO OF COURSE HE STAYED PUT
*/sample1193 HE HAD COLLARED ONE OF HIS GENERALS IN PUBLIC
*/sample1194 WOE BETIDE THE INTERVIEWEE IF HE ANSWERED VAGUELY
*/sample1195 PASSING DOGS WERE GREETED WITH A CORDIAL BARK
*/sample1196 HE HAD ACCORDINGLY CULTIVATED ECCENTRICITY TO THE POINT OF SECOND NATURE
*/sample1197 TRANSPARENT LOOK WAXY SKIN  COULD WELL BE UREMIA
*/sample1198 IT IS AWE-INSPIRING
*/sample1199 THEY CLOSE SOMETIME AFTER EIGHT
*/sample1200 LET HIM BECOME HONEST AND THEY DISCARD HIM
*/sample1201 WE HOPE THAT HE WILL EXECUTE IT IN A MANNER THAT WILL ENTITLE HIM TO CREDIT
*/sample1202 HIS ARTISTIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS GUARANTEED HIM ENTRY INTO ANY SOCIAL GATHERING
*/sample1203 INSTEAD OF THAT HE WAS ENGULFED BY BEDLAM
*/sample1204 THE PURCHASERS REJECTED THE ORDER IN TWO LETTERS WRITTEN IN VIGOROUS TERMS
*/sample1205 BUT WE AREN'T GOING TO LET YOU GIVE HIM ANY
*/sample1206 ALL ABOUT HIM STOOD TOMBSTONES HIS OWN SENSITIVE GREAT HANDS HAD FASHIONED
*/sample1207 BUT THEY WOULD RECONSIDER IT THEY ASSURED HIM IF HE WOULD REWRITE IT
*/sample1208 THIS DOCTRINE WAS REPUGNANT TO MY MORAL SENSE
*/sample1209 IF DISOBEYED THE RESULT IS TURMOIL AND CHAOS
*/sample1210 AS WE OBSERVE MORAL LAW AND PHYSICAL LAW THEY APPEAR AS BEING INEVITABLE
*/sample1211 THEIR BASIS SEEMS DEEPER THAN MERE AUTHORITY
*/sample1212 THEY ARE NOT TRUE BECAUSE SCIENTISTS OR PROPHETS SAY THEY ARE TRUE

*/sample1214 RELIGION THUS BECOMES INTEGRATED WITH LIFE
*/sample1215 THIS TRUTH THAT THE MORAL LAW IS NATURAL HAS OTHER IMPORTANT COROLLARIES

*/sample2006 HIS BLUE EYES SOUGHT THE SHIMMERING SEA OF HAZE AHEAD
*/sample2007 TO HIS PUZZLEMENT THERE SUDDENLY WAS NO HAZE
*/sample2008 HE SWUNG UP OVER THE WHEEL
*/sample2009 THE CLOUDS BULGED DOWNWARD AND BURST SUDDENLY INTO A GREAT BLACK FUNNEL
*/sample2010 THE CLOUDBURST CUT OFF ABRUPTLY
*/sample2011 AT LEAST THE WHEELS DUG IN
*/sample2012 HIS WIFE DIDN'T GIVE A SIGN SHE'D HEARD
*/sample2013 THEY WERE ALREADY SWOLLEN TO BURSTING
*/sample2014 SULPHUR OIL AND COPRA MAKE THE KIND OF TINDER ANY FIREBUG DREAMS OF
*/sample2015 THE LIFEBOATS WERE STUCK FAST
*/sample2016 HEAVE ON THOSE ROPES THE BOAT'S COME UNSTUCK
*/sample2017 LET'S HOPE WE COME TO A SAFER PLACE
*/sample2018 THEY WERE SHATTERED
*/sample2019 LATER YOU SHALL KNOW IT BETTER
*/sample2020 THE OLD WOMAN AROSE STIFFLY AND LED ME TO A CLEARING WHERE A SMALL HUT STOOD
*/sample2021 THEN HE WOULD REALIZE THEY WERE REALLY THINGS THAT ONLY HE HIMSELF COULD THINK
*/sample2022 WHAT OUTFIT DOES SHE DRIVE FOR
*/sample2023 NOWADAYS WE TALK AS THOUGH THE BLITZ WERE JUST A SHORT SKIRMISH
*/sample2024 THEY DON'T GO FOR BULL-LIKE MUSCLE AS A RULE
*/sample2025 HE DIDN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH HE NOW FREELY ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
*/sample2026 THE GREAT BLACK LEOPARDS
*/sample2027 THEY CAME UPON CHEETAL DEER AT WOODLAND POOLS
*/sample2028 HE TOOK HIS MASK FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND THREW IT UNEXPECTEDLY ACROSS THE DECK
*/sample2029 A NOTE OF AWE CAME INTO HIS VOICE
*/sample2030 OUR BOY DIDN'T CHICKEN OUT NO SIR
*/sample2031 WHATEVER YOU TELL HIM HE WILL DIVE
*/sample2032 HE TOOK A BIG SWIG OF HIS DRINK
*/sample2033 IT WOULD BE A COLOSSAL SHAME TO THROW AWAY A STORY LIKE THIS
*/sample2034 MAKE IT COME OFF ALL RIGHT
*/sample2035 HE FELT A GOOD DEAL LESS SHAKY
*/sample2036 AS HIS FEET SLOWED HE FELT ASHAMED OF THE PANIC AND RESOLVED TO MAKE A STAND
*/sample2037 HE CROSSED THE NEXT MEADOW AND CLIMBED A TREE WHERE THE JUNGLE TRAIL RESUMED
*/sample2038 HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF WITH FIRMNESS NO SURRENDER
*/sample2039 HIS SUPERIORS HAD ALSO PREACHED THIS SAYING IT WAS THE WAY FOR ETERNAL HONOR
*/sample2040 HIS COMRADES WERE ALL DEAD
*/sample2041 THE SHOT REVERBERATED IN DIMINISHING WHIPLASHES OF SOUND
*/sample2042 YOU CAME WELL EQUIPPED TO DIE
*/sample2043 ARE YOU A THROWER OF FLAME MARINE
*/sample2044 WET ALSO WERE THE MARINE'S FATIGUES AND THE FACE HAD AN OILY FILM
*/sample2045 BEFORE MUCH LONGER THE MARINE QUIETED DOWN
*/sample2046 HE STRAIGHTENED UP ALERT NOW AS THE BUFFALO HUNTER CAME CLOSER
*/sample2047 STAY RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU ARE KID HE CALLED
*/sample2048 THE KID HAS NO MANNERS BOYS
*/sample2049 SHALL WE TEACH HIM SOME
*/sample2050 A THIRD SHOT DOUSED THE LIGHT
*/sample2051 HE'LL SHOOT UP THE TOWN
*/sample2052 THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STREET COULD BE RAKED WITH RIFLE FIRE FROM THIS BARN
*/sample2053 HE SIZED UP THE SITUATION AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
*/sample2054 HE SLIPPED OUTSIDE HUGGING THE WALLS OF BUILDINGS AND DODGING INTO DOORWAYS
*/sample2055 CAN'T SEEM TO LOCATE LANDMARKS IN THIS SNOW
*/sample2056 ALL THAT TIME RIFLE BARRELS WERE POINTING UNWAVERINGLY AT HIS HEAD AND BODY
*/sample2057 HE STROLLED BACK TO THE DOOR WHISTLING SOFTLY HANDS STILL CLASPED BEHIND HIM
*/sample2058 WHY AIN'T YOU PLAYIN' BALL
*/sample2059 THEY PLAYED CRACK THE WHIP A FEW MINUTES WITHOUT MISHAP
*/sample2060 THANK YOU SHE SAID DUSTING HERSELF OFF
*/sample2061 MAYBE SOME OTHER DAY
*/sample2062 OH SHUCKS THE GIRL SAID
*/sample2063 TO HIS SURPRISE HIS PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY
*/sample2064 HE WAS GIFTED WITH ANIMAL MAGNETISM AND A POTENT ALLURE FOR WOMEN OF ANY RACE
*/sample2065 LIFTING HER SKIRTS SHE CLIMBED IN NEVER RELINQUISHING HER GRIP ON HIS ARM
*/sample2066 HE SAW A PINT-SIZED MAN WITH A GRAYING SPADE BEARD AND AN UNUSUALLY LARGE HEAD
*/sample2067 YEAH SEEMS SO DON'T IT THE BOY LAUGHED HUGGING HER CLOSE
*/sample2068 WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY
*/sample2069 HIS HEAD CAME UP AND HE SAID IT DEFIANTLY
*/sample2070 COME SIT HE REPEATED MOTIONING TO THE PILED HAY BAGS OVER THE PIG LEAVINGS
*/sample2071 YEAH BUT WHAT'RE WE GONNA EAT
*/sample2072 HE REACHED ONCE MORE INTO THE CARPET BAG AND BROUGHT UP A PACKAGE OF WIENERS
*/sample2073 HE RIPPED DOWN THE CELLOPHANE CAREFULLY AND LAID THREE DOGS ON THE TIN FOIL
*/sample2074 HOW COME YOU'RE RIDING THE RODS KIDS LIKE YOU
*/sample2075 NOW FORGET ALL THIS OTHER
*/sample2076 YOU GONNA GIVE ME A DRINK FELLA
*/sample2077 MAYBE YOU AND ME WILL GIRLIE BUT THESE TWO AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE
*/sample2078 OR THE BAY OF FEMALE DOGS IN HEAT
*/sample2079 THEY HAD SLAPPED THEIR THIGHS
*/sample2080 HE WOULD NOT CARRY A BRIEF CASE
*/sample2081 ALL THE WHILE SHE SAT THERE HER SINEWY ARMS SWIRLED BEFORE HER CHEST
*/sample2082 YOU'RE BOILING MILK AIN'T YOU
*/sample2083 ABOVE HIM SLID THE EVASIVE SHADOW OF A STORM CLOUD
*/sample2084 WHAT ABOUT A TEA ROOM THEN
*/sample2085 SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL SO VALIANT SO PITIABLE
*/sample2086 ABSOLUTION FOR HIS LIE
*/sample2087 WHY LACERATE THE  CONGREGATION
*/sample2088 HE'D HAD NO IDEA HOW UNHAPPY HIS SWEET PEACH HAD BEEN
*/sample2089 IF HE EVER DID SUCH A THING AGAIN SHE'D DIE OF SHAME
*/sample2090 HE SWUNG IN THROUGH HIS OWN WIDE GATEWAY
*/sample2091 NO TEMPTATION NO VIRTUE
*/sample2092 GO CHANGE YOUR SHOES BEFORE YOU TURN AROUND
*/sample2093 HE THEN OFFERED HIS OWN ESTIMATE OF THE WEATHER WHICH WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC
*/sample2094 HE SCOWLED AT HER FLOWERS
*/sample2095 MY DAD DID IT AND HE LIVED TO A GREAT AGE
*/sample2096 RAN AWAY ON A BLACK NIGHT WITH A LAWFUL WEDDED MAN
*/sample2097 LEFT MINE MANY A TIME ONLY SHE NEVER KNEW IT
*/sample2098 HE GAVE A SHORT HARD LAUGH AND LOOKED AT HER KNOWINGLY
*/sample2099 BUT SHE SUFFERED IN HER OFF-DUTY HOURS
*/sample2100 THEN AFTER A WHILE SHE WENT TO HER MIRROR
*/sample2101 JUST WHY ANYBODY SHOULD WISH TO START A RIOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DIDN'T KNOW
*/sample2102 HE MAY NOT RISE TO THE HEIGHTS BUT HE CAN GET BY AND EVENTUALLY BE RETIRED
*/sample2103 SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR
*/sample2104 AHAH HE THOUGHT A LUSH DIVORCEE AT LAST
*/sample2105 IT GAVE HER A LEWD WINKING EFFECT
*/sample2106 OUR KEY SALESMEN ARE IN APPLIANCES AND COSMETICS
*/sample2107 IT SOUNDED SILLY WHY GO ON
*/sample2108 DON'T FORGET WHISKEY IT'S SUCH A BIG SELLER
*/sample2109 SHE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN AS IF HE HAD SOMEHOW DISAPPOINTED THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
*/sample2110 WITH ANY LUCK AT ALL HE COULD EASILY FIND A FLOWERPOT
*/sample2111 BUT ROULETTE'S NOT MY GAME
*/sample2112 HE'S A PINTO AND HE PHOTOGRAPHS WONDERFULLY
*/sample2113 HOW'S YOUR LUCK HONEY
*/sample2114 STAKE ME SHE SAID AND LET ME AT THOSE DICE
*/sample2115 NAMED AFTER THE BALLET
*/sample2116 IS THERE ANY WORD YOU WOULD LIKE TO OFFER IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE
*/sample2117 HE SAW THE DANGERS NOT THE GLORIES OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS A MUTINEER
*/sample2118 THERE IS NOT SPACE TO HOLD OR FORCE TO GUARD ANY INCREASED NUMBER OF PRISONERS
*/sample2119 THE INSTINCT OF DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN LOST
*/sample2120 HE PAUSED THEN ADDED EVERYTHING ON A SHIP IS A WEAPON
*/sample2121 ANOTHER FIELD HAD GIVEN HIM FAME ENOUGH TO SATISFY ANY EGOTIST
*/sample2122 NOW THE HOPE WAS GONE
*/sample2123 THIS TRAGIC LAD HAD FORGED HIS OWN SHACKLES
*/sample2124 THE AIR SMELLED WARMISH AND FOUL
*/sample2125 HIS BLACK HAT WITH ITS WIDE BRIM HIGH CROWN AND FUR TRIM RODE HIGH
*/sample2126 ONE WHITE HAND POISED A STICK ABOVE HIS DESK
*/sample2127 THE GUTTURAL LANGUAGE FROM THE GHETTO STOPPED
*/sample2128 SOME OF THEM IGNORED THE TEXTS AND HAD APPARENTLY MEMORIZED THE WORDS LONG AGO
*/sample2129 HIS BODY PITCHED BACK AND FORTH ON THE BENCH
*/sample2130 DOES THIS BOTHER YOU
*/sample2131 YOU HAD TO BE STUPID OR CRAZY OR IMMORTAL
*/sample2132 SHE TOOK IT WITH HER WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE CHOSE IT
*/sample2133 HERE THEY DID NOT NEED TO BE IN GHETTOS
*/sample2134 ALL HIS FAMILY WAS DEAD EXCEPT FOR HIS SON
*/sample2135 YOU FEEL HIM EVERY MILE FURTHER AWAY
*/sample2136 EACH OF US HAD HIS OWN SPECIALTY BESIDES
*/sample2137 THE EYE IS ALL INWARD OR OUTWARD
*/sample2138 WHY SHOULD THIS SUDDENLY ASSAIL HER
*/sample2139 THEN THE TELEPHONING BEGAN
*/sample2140 WAS IT A HYSTERICAL RELEASE FROM THE LONG STRAIN OF VIGILANCE OF THOSE WEEKS
*/sample2141 IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT
*/sample2142 SHE OVERPLAYED HER HAND
*/sample2143 WHY PUT SUCH A HIGH VALUE ON BEING TOP DOG
*/sample2144 WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO WORRY ME
*/sample2145 WAS SHE JUST NATURALLY SLOPPY ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HER PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
*/sample2146 BUT IT WAS A HOPEFUL SIGN HE TOLD HIMSELF
*/sample2147 WHEN THEY GOT HOME AT MIDNIGHT SHE WAS TIRED OUT
*/sample2148 LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE
*/sample2149 LET'S BE FINE SUPERIOR PEOPLE OF GREAT DIGNITY HE SAID AS IF HE WERE JOKING
*/sample2150 THEN HE FLED NOT WAITING TO SEE IF SHE MINDED HIM OR TOOK NOTICE OF HIS CRY
*/sample2151 HE SANK BACK SIGHING AND WAS SOON ASLEEP AGAIN
*/sample2152 HIS FINGERS FUMBLED ACROSS THE BANDAGES
*/sample2153 HE RECOGNIZED HIS JACKET AND TROUSERS
*/sample2154 SHE MUST HAVE PUT HIS CLOTHES IN THE CLOSET
*/sample2155 HE WAS KNEELING TO TIE HIS SHOELACES
*/sample2156 HIS FINGERS FELT ABSURDLY THICK AND CLUMSY
*/sample2157 WHO WOULD TAKE OVER
*/sample2158 FOR A MOMENT HE FELT LIKE A THIEF DISCOVERED
*/sample2159 HER FACE SEEMED TO FLOAT IN AN IMPLAUSIBLY BRIGHT SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT
*/sample2160 HE HAD NEVER FELT PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO HER
*/sample2161 FORGET WE EVER KNEW WHAT
*/sample2162 HIS VOICE SEEMED THICK AND PURPOSELESS
*/sample2163 ARE YOU POSITIVE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT BY YOURSELF
*/sample2164 TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THEN
*/sample2165 NO REALLY RIGHT AS RAIN
*/sample2166 LOOK SWEETHEART SOME FOOL WAS
*/sample2167 A SMILE PULLED AT THE LOWER STRIP OF ADHESIVE TAPE
*/sample2168 THEY MAKE US CONFORMISTS LOOK GOOD
*/sample2169 UPSTAIRS BUSY FEET SHOWERING LIKE RAINDROPS PATTERED AROUND HER ROOM
*/sample2170 HIS DARK BROWS WHICH HAD BEEN LOWERED IN ANGER SMOOTHED
*/sample2171 HOW LONG WOULD IT BE OCCUPIED
*/sample2172 STRENGTH BEGAN TO ZIP UP AND DOWN HIS CHEST
*/sample2173 HE WADDED HIS SWEAT SHIRT INTO A BALL AND STRIPPED DOWN TO HIS SWIMMING TRUNKS
*/sample2174 AW SHUT UP HE SAID
*/sample2175 SHIVERING HE PUT ON HIS CLOTHES
*/sample2176 WATCH IT BIG SHOT A HOARSE VOICE YELLED BACK
*/sample2177 SHE WAS HOLDING ON TO HIS ROCK WITH ONE HAND
*/sample2178 HER COUGH SOUNDED LIKE CLOTH RIPPING
*/sample2179 MY MOTHER NEVER WOPS ME
*/sample2180 SHE SPOUTED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER INTO THE AIR
*/sample2181 PART COLLIE PART WIRE-HAIRED TERRIER
*/sample2182 NATURALLY CURLY HAIR RUNS IN MY FAMILY
*/sample2183 BOOKS ARE FOR SCHNOOKS
*/sample2184 EITHER THAT OR A VETERINARIAN
*/sample2185 SHE SAID SHARKS HAVE NO BONES AND SHRIMP SWAM BACKWARD
*/sample2186 HER FACE TURNED PINK WITH PLEASURE AND A SMOTHERED COUGH
*/sample2187 HE DAYDREAMED ON THE ROCK WHILE SHE SWAM AND SPLASHED AROUND
*/sample2188 HE SAYS HE'LL BE HERE ON THE ONE-O'CLOCK PLANE
*/sample2189 YOU SAW THEM ALWAYS TOGETHER THOSE YEARS
*/sample2190 NOW YOU KNOW SHE COULD'VE BUT SHE ISN'T THAT KIND OF GIRL
*/sample2191 SHE DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REFUSE
*/sample2192 BUT NOW SHE LOOKED UGLY
*/sample2193 NOW MAYBE THEY'D REALIZE THAT LIFE CAN BE TOUGH
*/sample2194 HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SOFT JOB AND NOW THE JOB WAS GONE AND HE WAS STRANDED
*/sample2195 VIRUS INFECTION NOTHING SHE'D SCREAM AT HIM
*/sample2196 A PROFESSION THAT BROUGHT ME AS GOOD AN INCOME AS MINE WASN'T TO BE SNEEZED AT
*/sample2197 THE WARD WAS A SMALL ONE FOUR BEDS KEPT RESERVED FOR FEMALE ALCOHOLICS
*/sample2198 BUT IF SHE WASN'T INTERESTED SHE'D JUST GO BACK TO THE SAME LIFE SHE'D LEFT
*/sample2199 WILL YOU TELL ME WHY
*/sample2200 SHE WENT ON DISREGARDING MY PROTESTS
*/sample2201 JUST LET ME DIE IN PEACE
*/sample2202 A LONG LONG WAY DOWN
*/sample2203 THE REASONS FOR THIS DIVE SEEMED FOOLISH NOW
*/sample2204 PRETTY SOON A WOMAN CAME ALONG CARRYING A FOLDED UMBRELLA AS A WALKING STICK
*/sample2205 SHE SAW ME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME THREE FEET AWAY
*/sample2206 NOT GOOD LOOKING BUT SELF-CONFIDENT AND WISE SO THAT IT MADE HER ATTRACTIVE

*/sample2212 THE RIDES WERE TAME ENOUGH  MOSTLY WE TALKED
*/sample2213 SOMEBODY WITH NO VICES
*/sample2214 AND NEVER SHOW MY FACE OR MY TRUCK AROUND HERE AGAIN
*/sample2215 IT WAS AS BLISSFUL AND FULFILLING A NIGHT AS ANY BRIDE EVER EXPERIENCED
*/sample2216 IT'S NEVER WRONG IF LOVE IS REAL
*/sample2217 HE'D NOT ONLY TOLD ME SO HE'D PROVED IT
*/sample2218 NO PRICE IS TOO HIGH WHEN TRUE LOVE IS AT STAKE
*/sample2219 SHARE BATH MAYBE  BUT SHARE REFRIGERATOR
*/sample2220 THE RED PILLS ARE A VITAMIN-AND-IRON COMPOUND
*/sample2221 THIS IS A SLEEPING CAPSULE
*/sample2222 YOU YOUNG MEN GET TO BE MY AGE YOU WON'T TAKE FLU SO LIGHTLY
*/sample2223 IN THESE DAMP CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS AN ODDS-ON BET TO DEVELOP PNEUMONIA
