OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC UPLIFT
ONE EVEN GAVE MY LITTLE DOG A BISCUIT
MAYBE HE WILL HELP TO TURN OUR FAIR CITY INTO A GHOST TOWN
WHY DO WE NEED BIGGER AND BETTER BOMBS
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPRESSWAY STEMS FROM THE BASIC IDEA
BRIDGES TUNNELS AND FERRIES ARE THE MOST COMMON METHODS OF RIVER CROSSINGS
REPLACE IT WITH THE STATUE OF ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE WORLD'S FAMOUS DICTATORS
WHO WANTS THIS DEED DONE
THE GALLANT HALF-CITY IS DYING ON ITS FEET
THE TRIAL BALLOONS ARE AFLOAT
THEIR PRIVATIONS ARE ALMOST BEYOND ENDURANCE
ON THESE THEY FEEL THEY CAN RELY
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH IS THE MOMENT OF CRISIS
NEW SELF-DECEIVING RAGS ARE HURRIEDLY TOSSED ON THE TOO-NAKED BONES
WHAT EXPLAINS THIS UNI-DIRECTIONAL PARALYSIS
ORIGINALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOOD AND ADAPTATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD
BUT THAT EXPLANATION IS ONLY PARTLY TRUE
BUT THE SHIPS ARE VERY SLOW NOW AND WE DON'T GET SO MANY SAILORS ANY MORE
MELANCHOLY OBSESSION
THEY WERE SHOWN HOW TO ADVANCE AGAINST AN ENEMY OUTPOST ATOP A CLEARED RIDGE
WE WOULD LOSE OUR EXPORT MARKETS AND DENY OURSELVES THE IMPORTS WE NEED
WITH THIS NO LOYAL CITIZEN CAN QUARREL
MERCENARY TERM OF HONOR
THIS POSSIBILITY IS ANYTHING BUT REASSURING
THE PUBLIC IS NOW ARMED WITH SOPHISTICATION AND NUMEROUS COMPETING MEDIA
BUT THE ATTACK WAS MADE FROM AN ADVANCE COPY
WELL NOW WE HAVE TWO BIG THEATERS
SPLENDOR BY SORCERY IT'S A HORROR
ONE-UPMANSHIP IS PRACTICED BY BOTH SIDES IN A TOTAL WAR
THIS BIG FLEXIBLE VOICE WITH UNCOMMON RANGE HAS BEEN SUPERBLY DISCIPLINED
HER DEBUT OVER PERHAPS THE EARLIER SCENES WILL EMERGE EQUALLY FINE
HE INJECTED MORE VITALITY INTO THE SCORE THAN IT HAS REVEALED IN MANY YEARS
THE STORYLINE IN SORT IS WILDLY UNREALISTIC
HE TALKED ABOUT UNAUTHENTIC STORYLINES TOO
HE PRAISES MANY INDIVIDUALS GENEROUSLY
HIS PORTRAYAL OF AN EDGY HEAD-IN-THE-CLOUDS ARTIST IS VIRTUALLY FLAWLESS
NOT A CORNER HAS BEEN VISIBLY CUT IN THIS ONE
THE MASTER'S HAND HAS LOST NONE OF ITS CRAFT
HE SHOWED PUNY MEN ATTACKED BY SPLENDIDLY TYRANNICAL MACHINES
HE MAY HAVE A POINT IN URGING THAT DECADENT THEMES BE GIVEN FEWER PRIZES
A TINY HANDFUL NEVER DID MAKE THE CONCERT
THE WORKS ARE PRESENTED CHRONOLOGICALLY
THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION CAN BE IMAGINED
IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
HIS TECHNIQUE IS AMPLE AND HIS MUSICAL IDEAS ARE PROJECTED BEAUTIFULLY
WHAT A DISCUSSION CAN ENSUE WHEN THE TITLE OF THIS TYPE OF SONG IS IN QUESTION
PROGRAM NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS TAKE HANDS THIS URGENT VISAGE BECKONS US
THE ORCHESTRA WAS OBVIOUSLY ON ITS METTLE AND IT PLAYED MOST RESPONSIVELY
HE LIKED TO NIP EAR LOBES OF UNSUSPECTING VISITORS WITH HIS NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH
HERE HE IS QUITE PERSUASIVELY THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF MEANNESS AND SLYNESS
HE IS A MAN OF MAJOR TALENT  BUT A MAN OF SOLITARY UNCERTAIN IMPULSES
HE WAS ABOVE ALL A FRIEND SEEKER ALMOST PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO BE LIKED
HE ENLISTED A STAFF OF LOYAL EXPERTS AND OF MANY ZEALOUS VOLUNTEERS
THIS THEORY EVENTUALLY PROVED INEXACT
THE HEAVENS REFUSED TO GIVE UP THEIR WEEPING
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS CREEPING MANNERISM
CLEVER LIGHT SONGS WERE OVERLY COY TRAGIC SONGS A LITTLE TOO MELODRAMATIC
THEIR PROPS WERE TWO STEPLADDERS A CHAIR AND A PALM FAN
THE ARMCHAIR TRAVELER PRESERVES HIS ILLUSIONS
ALL ARE WELL WRITTEN AND ARE OVERWRITTEN
HE IGNORES GUIDEBOOK FACTS
NICE EVEN IF A TRIFLE GAUDY
BELOW IS A SPECIFIC GUIDE KEYED TO THE CALENDAR
A SAILBOAT MAY HAVE A BONE IN HER TEETH ONE MINUTE AND LIE BECALMED THE NEXT
IT SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF UNITY OF PURPOSE AND RESPECT FOR HEROIC LEADERSHIP
THE FAT MAN HAS TROUBLE BUYING LIFE INSURANCE OR HAS TO PAY HIGHER PREMIUMS
FAR MORE FREQUENTLY OVEREATING IS THE RESULT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPULSION
JUST WHAT IS MEANT BY SPIRIT AND BY MATTER
SURELY THIS IS A REALITY WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE
YET IT EXISTS AND HAS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY WHICH CAN BE EXPERIENCED AND KNOWN
YET THE SPIRIT WHICH LIVES IN COMMUNITY IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH THE COMMUNITY
BUT THIS STATEMENT IS COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING
A SECOND POINT REQUIRES MORE EXTENDED COMMENT
THE STRAIGHT LINE WOULD SYMBOLIZE ITS UNIQUENESS THE CIRCLE ITS UNIVERSALITY
HIS HISTORY IS HIS ALONE YET EACH MAN MUST RECOGNIZE HIS OWN HISTORY IN IT
HISTORICAL EXISTENCE IS A CREATED GOOD
DEATH REMINDS MAN OF HIS SIN BUT IT REMINDS HIM ALSO OF HIS TRANSIENCE
SUCH A CALM AND ASSURING PEACE CAN BE YOURS
SATELLITES SPUTNIKS ROCKETS BALLOONS WHAT NEXT
LOOK AT THE THINGS WE DO TO ESCAPE OUR FEARS AND TO FORGET OUR WORRIES
MEANWHILE THE ENEMY WILL CAPITALIZE ON OUR FEARS IF HE CAN
OUR ENEMY IS ALSO THREATENING TO DEVOUR US
YES INDEED WE TOO CAN SEE A WARLIKE HOST OF INFIDELS ENCAMPED AGAINST US
WE ARE ALL INVOLVED IN THEM DEEPLY INVOLVED
LATER WE SHALL SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AN EMPEROR TOOK THIS IDEA TOO LITERALLY
NEGLECT MEANS SPIRITUAL PARALYSIS OR DEATH
A HELPFUL LEAFLET MAY BE ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER
NONE SHOULD ASK LESS
PSYCHOLOGICALLY THE RECEPTION SHOULD BE THE CLIMAX FOLLOWING THE SERMON
THIS IS NO SPECTATOR-TYPE EXPERIENCE EVERYONE IS TO BE A PARTICIPANT
BOTH EVENTUALITIES ARE POSSIBLE LOGICALLY BUT PRACTICALLY THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE
THEOCRACY RECONSIDERED
COMPARABLE TRENDS CAN BE NOTED ELSEWHERE
SALVATION RECONSIDERED
HE IS NOT TALKING IN THE MAIN ABOUT PROBABILITIES RISKS AND DANGER IN GENERAL
NO POLITICAL ORDER OR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS SO CLEARLY CONTRARY TO NATURE
WOULD SUCH AN ACT OF REFUSAL BE USEFUL
OFTEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IN ONLY BECAUSE THE AREA IS DECLINING ECONOMICALLY
AN OCTILLION ATOMS  NOW LET US SEE WHERE THIS POWER COMES FROM
THIS IS THE ATOMIC SUN THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS
AT ANY RATE IT SHOWS US HOW IMMATERIAL WE ARE
OTHERS WERE EPHEMERAL
THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT TOOK MANY FORMS
THE DEAD SPIRITS OCCUPIED A PROMINENT PLACE IN EVERY HOPE AND IN EVERY FEAR
MEN BELIEVED THEY COULD CONTROL NATURE BY OBEYING A MORAL CODE
PROPRIETY WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH RITUAL OBSERVANCE THE MARK OF A TRUE GENTLEMAN
BUT THIS ESOTERIC DOCTRINE WAS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE TO ACQUIRE SPECIAL POWERS
WHY SAID THE TEACHER ART THOU SO LATE
HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE ABIDES IN DEATH
THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS AND MYSTERIOUS
THE NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS
SOME HAVE WALKED THROUGH PAIN AND SORROW TO BRING YOU THEIR MESSAGE OF HOPE
BUT FROM THE START THEY HAD TWO IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS SINCERITY AND REALISM
THE CRISIS LATER ON WHEN DEBTS SEEMED ABOUT TO OVERWHELM ME
YOU'RE NOT LIVING UP TO YOUR OWN PRINCIPLES SHE TOLD MY DISCOURAGED PEOPLE
YOU'RE SO PREOCCUPIED THAT YOU'VE LET YOUR FAITH GROW DIM
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO ASSURE MY CONTINUED EXISTENCE
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE POWER OF FAITH AT WORK AMONG US
IT WAS MUSCULAR BUT IT WASN'T SYMMETRICAL
OH YOU'LL WOBBLE AND WEAVE QUITE A BIT AT FIRST
ANTS CARRY AWAY THE SEEDS SO BETTER BE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO ANT HILLS NEARBY
PANSIES ARE GLUTTONS
THE AVOCADO SHOULD HAVE A GIVE TO IT AS YOU HOLD IT WHEN IT IS RIPE
THERE IS NO DYEING OR WAXING OR GASSING NEEDED
AVOCADOS HOWEVER ARE VERY RICH IN NUTRIENTS
HOWEVER THE AIRCRAFT WHICH WE HAVE TODAY ARE TIED TO LARGE SOFT AIRFIELDS
NUCLEAR ROCKETS CAN DESTROY AIRFIELDS WITH EASE
OUR FIRST NECESSITY AT THE VERY OUTSET OF WAR IS POST-ATTACK RECONNAISSANCE
WHAT TARGETS HAVE WE SUCCESSFULLY KNOCKED OUT
OTHER INTERPRETATIONS PRESENT THE MUSIC AS AN ESSENTIALLY INTIMATE CREATION
FOR ME IT HAS MORE OF BOTH ELEMENTS THAN THE MAJORITY OF ITS COMPETITORS
THERE ARE CANOES IDEAL FOR FISHING IN PROTECTED WATERS OR FOR CAMPING TRIPS
NOW HERE IS TRULY A MARVEL
STATE NUMBERING LAWS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN MANY WAYS
INDUSTRY INTEREST IN SAFETY GOES EVEN FARTHER
FILE TO A SMOOTH FINISH
THIS TOOL CAN ALSO BE MADE WITH A LATHE
THIS CHANGES THE FORMULA TO AN EQUATION
THE TOTAL OF THESE THREE VOLUMES IS THE FINAL COMBUSTION CHAMBER VOLUME
IT'S A STREAMLINED RIFLE FAST AND WELL-MADE
A SPRING TRAP FOR SOLID MOUNTING AND A REGULAR HAND TRAP ARE ALSO AVAILABLE
PROMPTLY AT SEVEN HE WOULD CLATTER OUT OF THE COURT WITH TWELVE IN THE TALLYHO
THEN SIMMER FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER
POACH THE APPLES IN THIS SYRUP FOR TWELVE MINUTES DRAIN THEM AND COOL
BEST SOLUTION IS TO FIND AN AREA THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY SUNLIGHT OR SHADE
ANOTHER MEMO FOR SIGHTSEERS BRING YOUR CAMERA ALONG TO MUSEUMS
A FEW YEARS LATER THE DOME FELL IN
DO LINE BARBECUE FIRE BOWL WITH HEAVY FOIL TO REFLECT HEAT
DO AVOID PUNCTURING OR CUTTING INTO MEATS TO TEST THEM
IF NECESSARY TO REPLACE BOTH HALVES ON GRILL SEAR CUTS AND ALLOT EXTRA TIME
FOR ROASTS INSERT MEAT THERMOMETER DIAGONALLY SO IT DOES NOT REST ON BONE
ALSO MAKE SURE THERMOMETER DOES NOT TOUCH THE REVOLVING SPIT OR HIT THE COALS
HAVE A TEST-RUN ON THE FAMILY FIRST TO BE SURE TIMING AND SEASONING ARE RIGHT
DON'T PLAN MEALS THAT ARE TOO COMPLICATED
KEEP THE DESSERTS SIMPLE FRUIT DOES NICELY
DO WITHOUT FANCY TABLECLOTHS
IN THE WINTER HIBACHI IN THE KITCHEN OR GRILL OVER THE LOGS OF THE FIREPLACE
SUMMERTIME SUPPER OUTSIDE IS A NATURAL
DO BUY ALL-PURPOSE MUGS OR CUPS
GET COPPER OR EARTHENWARE MUGS THAT KEEP BEER CHILLED OR SOUP HOT

FOR SWEET-SOUR SAUCE COOK ONION IN OIL UNTIL SOFT
ADD REMAINING INGREDIENTS AND BRING TO A BOIL
TO PREPARE MUSTARD CREAM BLEND MUSTARD WITH ENOUGH WATER TO MAKE A THIN PASTE

TRIM EXCESS CLAY AWAY FROM OUTER EDGES
OPAQUE CANTALOUPE AND TRANSPARENT WOOD BROWN WERE USED
PAPERWEIGHT MAY BE PERSONALIZED ON BACK WHILE CLAY IS LEATHER HARD
FILL SMALL HOLE IN BOWL WITH CLAY
JARS ARE ASSEMBLED IN BOWL OF BUTTER MOLD
TRIM EXCESS CLAY FROM AROUND LIP OF MOLD AND SET ASIDE WHILE ASSEMBLING LID

SET ASIDE TO DRY THOROUGHLY
TRIM AWAY EXCESS CLAY REINFORCE SEAM WITH A COIL OF CLAY
MAKE LID FOR SUGAR BOWL THE SAME AS JAR LIDS OMITTING DESIGN DISK
SET ASIDE TO DRY WITH LID ON SUGAR BOWL
VASES MAKE SAME AS SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS LEAVING OFF TOP PIECES
VASES MAY BE MADE INTO CANDLES BY FILLING WITH MELTED WAX AND A WICK
A CARDBOARD PATTERN CUT TO FIT INSIDE HOLDER WILL HELP TO PREVENT WARPING
LET ALL PROJECTS DRY SLOWLY FOR SEVERAL DAYS
PLACE WORK ON A FLAT SURFACE AND SMOOTH OUT
THREAD MATCHING YARN IN TAPESTRY NEEDLE
DO NOT DRAW YARN TOO TIGHT
EASE IN ANY EXTRA FULLNESS EVENLY AROUND
NOR IS SHE A WET BOAT
THE KEELSON MADE OF TWO THREE-INCH WIDTHS IS NEXT INSTALLED
THE SIDE ONES ARE A HALF-INCH NARROWER
AGAIN THESE BLOCKS WERE SET IN RESIN-SATURATED GLASS CLOTH AND NAILED
THE DECKING IS QUARTER-INCH MAHOGANY MARINE PLYWOOD
YOU CAN BUILD THIS VACATION COTTAGE YOURSELF
IT IS A BIG PROJECT NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
THE THEORY THE IDEA BEHIND OUR DESIGN IS MODULAR UNITS OR PANELIZATION
DON'T LOSE THE CHUCK KEY
FEED PRESSURE IS ALSO OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE
WE HAVE BECOME AMATEUR INSURANCE EXPERTS AND FINE-FEATHERED YARD BIRDS
BUT PROBLEMS CLING TO POOLS AS ANY POOL OWNER KNOWS
WE SEEMED TO BE WITNESSING THE POPULATION EXPLOSION RIGHT IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS
SO RULES WE MADE IN UNABASHED COLLUSION
BUT FENCED OR UNFENCED NO POOL-SIDE IS THE PLACE FOR RUNNING OR HORSEPLAY
A POOL IS NO PLACE FOR A SHUT TRAP
YOU SHOULD FIRMLY INSIST THAT NO BOBBY PINS OR HAIR PINS BE WORN IN THE WATER
WHEN SHED THEY LEAVE RUST MARKS
THE FILTERED AIR BENEFITS ALLERGIES ASTHMA SINUS HAY FEVER
THE NEED FOR REUPHOLSTERING REDECORATING REPAINTING BECOMES MORE INFREQUENT
WHEN YOU'RE LESS FATIGUED THINGS JUST NATURALLY LOOK BRIGHTER
THAT BRINGS ITS PER-YEAR COST DOWN MIGHTY LOW
THE SIMPLEST KIND OF SEPARATE SYSTEM USES A SINGLE SELF-CONTAINED UNIT
IN A NEW HOUSE GENEROUS ROOF OVERHANGS ARE A LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION
THEY'RE EASIER TO SHADE THERE
INSULATE WEATHERSTRIP DOUBLE-GLAZE TO THE MAXIMUM
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN SITE SELECTION
BEGIN THE EXAMINATION OF A SITE WITH A GOOD MAP AND AERIAL PHOTOS IF POSSIBLE
YOU NEED ANSWERS TO FOUR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
ONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE FEATURES FOR A PARK ARE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OR SCENERY
A SITE MAY ALSO BE ATTRACTIVE JUST THROUGH THE BEAUTY OF ITS TREES AND SHRUBS
TOPOGRAPHY  TOPOGRAPHY IS VERY IMPORTANT
AN AREA SHELTERED FROM STRONG WINDS MAY BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR RECREATION USE
MEANWHILE THREE GREAT TERRIBLE FORCES WERE COAGULATING AND CRYSTALLIZING
NEED FOR NOVELTY MAY BE A SYMPTOM OF CULTURAL FATIGUE AND INSTABILITY
PUSH-UPS PUSH-UPS ARE ESSENTIAL BUT FEW HAVE THE STRENGTH FOR THEM AT FIRST
FALL SLOWLY FORWARD ONTO THE HANDS AND LET THE BODY DOWN TO REST ON THE FLOOR
PUSH BACK UP AND REPEAT
DO THIS EXERCISE SIX TIMES EACH CLASS PERIOD
THIS WILL PREVENT FLAT FALLS AND TOE INJURIES
BONES AND CARTILAGE TRANSMIT POORLY AND TEND TO REFLECT THE ULTRASONIC SIGNALS
THERE FORCES ARE MORE LATENT THAN IN ELECTRICITY AND LESS THAN IN MAGNETISM
BY THAT ONE FEELS THAT MAGNETIC FORCES ARE AS GENERAL AS ELECTRICAL FORCES
THE TARGET CHART QUICKLY AND BRIEFLY TELLS YOU WHICH ADDITIVES DO WHAT
MILK PRODUCTION MAY BE INCREASED BY THE ANTI-INFECTIVE PROPERTIES OF THIS DRUG
THE DRUG IS ALSO INCORPORATED IN SUPPLEMENTS
SEVERAL FIRMS ARE MERCHANDISING ENZYME PREPARATION THROUGH FEED MANUFACTURERS
WHAT IT DOES AIDS IN PREVENTING FOAMY BLOAT
CAUTION CONTINUOUS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LACTATING COWS
DRUG'S CHEMICAL NAME PROCAINE PENICILLIN
DRUG'S CHEMICAL NAME DRIED RUMEN BACTERIA
WHAT IT DOES STIMULATES RUMEN ACTIVITY
NO ONE MATERIAL IS BEST FOR ALL SITUATIONS
SELECTING BUNKS BY ECONOMIC COMPARISON IS USUALLY AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM
WIDER DISCRETIONARY CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS
LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP
IT HAS MULTIPLE IMPLICATIONS AND POSSIBLE HEADACHES FOR YOUR MARKETING PROGRAM
SALESMANSHIP IS STILL NECESSARY BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT BRAND OF SALESMANSHIP
NO MANUFACTURER HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE IN POINTING OUT THE COSTS INVOLVED
COMPUTERS ARE BEING USED TO KEEP BRANCH INVENTORIES AT MORE WORKABLE LEVELS
INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
PRACTICALLY ALL FORECASTS MENTION NEW AND EXCITING PRODUCTS ON THE HORIZON
COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING
EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM TOUCHED ON THUS FAR IS RELATED TO GOOD MARKETING PLANNING
ARE PLANNING AND STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT EMPHASIZED SUFFICIENTLY IN YOUR COMPANY
TO BEGIN WITH WHAT IS AN INTERIOR DESIGNER
THUS TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IS ACHIEVED AT THE EXPENSE OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
BUT TO CONTINUE TO DIVORCE ADVANCED STUDENTS FROM REALITY IS INEXCUSABLE
THIS BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION OF ACCREDITATION OF ART SCHOOLS IN GENERAL
IS IT LARGER OR FANCIER THAN YOU REALLY NEED
CAN YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY AID YOU IN REDUCING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
WOULD A CAMERA CLUB BE USEFUL IN TAKING PICTURES PERTINENT TO PLANT SAFETY
ARE YOU UNDERWRITING EXPENSIVE TEAM TRIPS
ARE YOU UTILIZING VENDING MACHINE PROCEEDS TO HELP PAY FOR YOUR PROGRAM
IF YOU USE PARKING ATTENDANTS CAN THEY BE REPLACED BY AUTOMATIC PARKING GATES
AIM TO BALANCE YOUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PACKAGE
ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXERCISE THEIR BENEFITS
USE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE WHEREVER FEASIBLE
PUT A DOLLAR-AND-CENTS LIMIT ON BENEFITS
OTHERWISE YOU MAY BE SADDLED WITH A GOOD-SIZE MILK BILL BY MILK DRINKERS
CHOOSE CAREFULLY BETWEEN CONTRIBUTORY OR NON-CONTRIBUTORY PENSION PLANS
A NON-CONTRIBUTORY PLAN USUALLY WON'T PAY OFF FOR THE WORKER UNTIL HE RETIRES
THESE INCLUDE LEAVES OF ABSENCES ILLNESSES AND LAYOFFS
LATEST MODELS SERVE HOT MEALS AT REASONABLE PRICES AND AT A PROFIT TO YOU
IF A CONCESSIONAIRE RUNS THE CAFETERIA KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR QUALITY AND PRICE
CHECK YOUR CAFETERIA LOCATION TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONVENIENT FOR MOST EMPLOYEES
THE LONG AND EVER-INCREASING COLUMN OF SPORTSMEN IS NOW MOVING INTO A NEW ERA
NEITHER ARE BEDS THANKS TO AIR MATTRESSES AND SLEEPING BAGS
THE OLD SHOP ADAGE STILL HOLDS A GOOD MECHANIC IS USUALLY A BAD BOSS
A COMPLETE PLAN WE HAVE MADE LIMITED APPLICATION OF THE PARALLEL LADDER PLAN
THE HIGHEST RATED NON-SUPERVISORY ENGINEERING TITLE IS RESEARCH ENGINEER
THE IDEA OF A CENTRAL TANK WITH LINES TO EACH HOUSE IS NOT IN ITSELF A NOVELTY
IT WILL ACCOMMODATE FIRING RATES AS LOW AS A HALF GALLON AN HOUR
THE WORD MEANS IT WON'T BOIL AWAY EASILY NOTHING ELSE
THEN FILL THE SYSTEM AND ADD A RUST INHIBITOR
BE CAREFUL THAT YOU KEEP ADEQUATE COVERAGE BUT LOOK FOR PLACES TO SAVE MONEY
FIRST GO OVER THE TYPE OF COVERAGE YOU NOW HAVE
LOOK FOR THESE FEATURES WHICH MAY MEAN YOU CAN SAVE DUPLICATE COVERAGE
DOES YOUR POLICY HAVE A LAY-UP CLAUSE
THE FIGURE FIVE IS IMPORTANT IN INSURANCE
THIS MEANS EITHER CARS OR TRUCKS
LARGE INJECTION-MOLDED LETTERS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR SIGN INSTALLATIONS
THE REVOLUTION NOW UNDER WAY IN MATERIALS HANDLING MAKES THIS MUCH EASIER
BEFORE THAT WE LUMBER DEALERS WERE WORKING ALMOST SINGLE-HANDED ON THE PROBLEM
THE WAY IS TO RENT A CHAUFFEUR-DRIVEN CAR
ANY RETALIATORY GAS ATTACK WOULD BE AIRBORNE
HE HOPED THEY WOULD PUT IN SOMEWHERE WAY WAY DOWN IN THE EARTH
NINE OF THEM HAD GONE DOWN THE GANGPLANK ALREADY
HE SNATCHED AT IT SAVAGELY
ANOTHER LONGER STRIP OF TINSEL WHIPPED HIS MOUTH
IS A DREAM SIMPLY A MENTAL OR CEREBRAL MOVIE
IN MOST CASES WE RECOGNIZE CERTAIN WORDS PERSONS ANIMALS OR OBJECTS
BUT WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO REPRODUCE THE RETINAL IMAGE WITHIN THE BRAIN
IT WAS APPLIED WITH A COMPOST SHREDDER MADE FROM A CONVERTED MANURE SPREADER
NO CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS AND POISONOUS INSECTICIDES AND FUNGICIDES ARE USED
THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH CORN PEAS OR STRAWBERRIES
NEW IDEAS FOR IMPROVING NUTRITION CAME WITH THE STUDY OF SOIL TREATMENT
ADULTS TAKE A LONG TIME TO CONVINCE AND YOU ARE THWARTED IF YOU TRY TO PUSH
IT IS WELL LIKED BY THE CHILDREN AND FACULTY
THEY SERVE CRACKED WHEAT OATS OR CORNMEAL
WHERE CAN WE GET THIS CEREAL HE LIKES SO MUCH
HOME-MADE SAUERKRAUT IS SERVED ONCE A WEEK
SPROUTED GRAINS AND SEEDS ARE USED IN SALADS AND DISHES SUCH AS CHOP SUEY
MILK APPEARS TWICE A DAY
THE SOURCE IS KNOWN SO THERE IS NO NECESSITY TO REMOVE INSECTICIDE RESIDUES
A VIGOROUS PROGRAM EXISTED IN SKIING SKATING SPORTS AND OVERNIGHT HIKING
HE PEERED AHEAD AND GRINNED AS THE RAILROAD TRACKS CAME INTO VIEW AGAIN BELOW
HIS WORK BEGAN JUST SIX DAYS AFTER THE FLOOD
IT TOOK A TRAGEDY TO BRING THINGS TO A HEAD
SOMEHOW WE OLD-TIMERS NEVER FIGURED WE WOULD EVER RETIRE
WE ALWAYS THOUGHT WE WOULD DIE WITH OUR BOOTS ON
COMPULSORY RETIREMENT AT SIXTY-FIVE LOOMS ON OUR HORIZON
TO PUT IT BLUNTLY YOU ARE GETTING OUT-MODED
THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A BOOM IN CONFERENCES
YOU MAY AMAZE YOURSELF AND ACQUIRE A REAL KNACK FOR IT
DO YOU LOVE TO RUN UP A HEM SEW ON BUTTONS MAKE NEAT BUTTONHOLES
IF YOU DO GO TO IT
THEN AGAIN THERE'S ALWAYS THAT LOVELY OLD PASTIME OF HOOKING OR BRAIDING RUGS
SOME MAKE BEAUTIFUL CHAIRS CABINETS CHESTS DOLL HOUSES ETC
SOME WOMEN GET A REAL THRILL OUT OF HOUSEWORK
WE KNOW THAT ACTORS CAN LEARN TO PORTRAY A WIDE VARIETY OF CHARACTER ROLES
OBVIOUSLY THE BRIDAL PAIR HAS MANY ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE TO THEIR NEW SITUATION
TOO MANY NEW THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR IT TO BE A COMPLETE EROTIC FULFILLMENT
DIFFERENCES WERE RELATED TO SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS
IN TRADITION AND IN POETRY THE MARRIAGE BED IS A PLACE OF UNITY AND HARMONY
TO MANY EXPERTS THIS TREND WAS INEVITABLE
THEY CONSIDER IT SIMPLY A SIGN OF OUR TIMES
WHILE HE WAS IN CUSTODY HIS WIFE DIVORCED HIM
ANOTHER PUT SEX ON A DOLLARS-AND-CENTS BASIS
NATURALLY NO WOMAN CAN EVER COMPLETELY MONOPOLIZE THE SEXUAL INITIATIVE
ASKED WHY HE REPLIED PRIMLY BECAUSE THAT'S NO ACTIVITY FOR A GENTLEMAN
BUT SUCH CASES WERE IN THE PAST UNUSUAL
WHEN DID WOMEN BEGIN TO ASSERT THEMSELVES SEXUALLY
OFTEN SHE FAILS TO GAIN SEXUAL SATISFACTION
HIS PRESCRIPTION HOT AND COLD COMPRESSES TO INCREASE HER ABSORPTION OF WATER
THAT'S WHERE DEVICE QUACKERY CAN LEAD
AUTHORITIES SAY THAT OLDSTERS ARE A PRIME TARGET
CROOKED OVERLAPPING TWISTED OR WIDELY SPACED TEETH
ALIGNING ALL THE TEETH MAY TAKE A YEAR OR MORE
LET THE ORTHODONTIST DECIDE THE PROPER TIME TO START TREATMENT HE URGES
SUPERIOR NEW MATERIAL FOR ORTHODONTIC WORK IS ANOTHER RESULT OF RESEARCH
IMPRESSIONS OFTEN APPEAR IN A SYMBOLIC FORM AND CANNOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE
DURING ONE READING AN IMAGE APPEARED OF A PRISONER IN IRONS
THE FARMER'S LIFE MUST BE ARRANGED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CROPS AND LIVESTOCK
LIVESTOCK MUST BE TENDED EVERY DAY ROUTINELY
PRODUCTION MAY FALL FAR BELOW EXPECTATIONS
IF THE FARM IS RENTED THE RENT MUST BE PAID
ADVANTAGES A FARM PROVIDES A WHOLESOME AND HEALTHFUL ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN
AS A RULE PART-TIME FARMERS HIRE LITTLE HELP
FEW RURAL AREAS ARE PROTECTED BY ZONING
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO DO ANY NECESSARY MODERNIZING AND REDECORATING
IT MAY BE HARD TO DECIDE WHAT THIS LABOR IS WORTH BUT CHARGE SOMETHING FOR IT
AS SUCH IT WAS BEYOND POLITICS AND HAD NO NEED OF JUSTIFICATION BY A MESSAGE
ALL TOO OFTEN OUR LANGUAGE IS UNDULY HARSH
THAT EXPERIENCE HOLDS A LESSON FOR US ALL IN REGARD TO BIRTH CONTROL TODAY
HISTORIANS HAVE HAD TWO REASONS FOR PERSISTING SO LONG IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
FIRST THEY WANTED TO CLARIFY A TANTALIZING BIZARRE ENIGMA
WORSE HIS PRESENT CREW INCLUDED FIVE MEN WHO HAD SAILED WITH HIM BEFORE
TURBULENT TIDES ROSE AS MUCH AS FIFTY FEET
BUT HE WAS VERY MUCH LIKE HIS ASSOCIATES IN HIS HATRED OF CAMP ROUTINE
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON OF CAMP MALADIES WAS DIARRHOEA
SOMETIMES SOLDIERS WROTE LETTERS WHILE BULLETS WERE WHIZZING ABOUT THEIR HEADS
NO GROUP OF OFFICERS CAME IN FOR MORE SPIRITED DENUNCIATION THAN THE DOCTORS
THE COALITION WAS TO PROVE INADVISABLE
LIKE A FAIR NUMBER OF BOOTLEGGERS HE DISLIKED ALCOHOL
HOWEVER THIS INAUGURAL FEAST DID ITS SPONSORS NO GOOD WHATEVER
THE DIMENSIONS OF THESE WAVES DWARF ALL OUR USUAL STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT
A TSUNAMI IS NOT A SINGLE WAVE BUT A SERIES
A SHARP TREMOR WAS FOLLOWED BY A JERKY ROLL
HE NOT ONLY KNEW SOLDIERING BUT MATHEMATICS HISTORY AND LITERATURE AS WELL
ALONG THE MAIN THOROUGHFARES HARDLY A HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN PEPPERED
WHAT HAD BEEN THE AMBASSADOR'S SUITE WAS NOW JAGGED WALLS OF BLACKENED BRICK
WE FLEW IN RICKETY PLANES SO OVERLOADED THAT WE WONDERED WHY THEY DIDN'T CRASH
THEN OFF AGAIN RUSHING TO KEEP UP
WE SEND SHOVELS CEMENT NAILS AND CORRUGATED IRON FOR ROOFS
THEN CAME COCONUTS EGGS AND RICE WINE
THEN WE WERE OFF AGAIN
BUT OUR STUMPING TOUR OF THE SOUTH WASN'T ALL MISERY
NOW A DISTINGUISHED OLD MAN CALLED ON NINE DIVINITIES TO COME AND JOIN US
NEXT HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO OUR SOULS
FOR GIRLS THE OVERPROTECTION IS FAR MORE PERVASIVE
ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE SENIOR CLASS IS MARRIED STUDENTS SAY DOGMATICALLY
BRUISES AND BLACK EYES WERE RELIEVED BY APPLICATION OF RAW BEEFSTEAK
A CHAW OF TOBACCO PUT ON AN OPEN WOUND WAS BOTH ANTISEPTIC AND HEALING
TETANUS COULD BE AVOIDED BY POURING WARM TURPENTINE OVER A WOUND
RABIES WERE CURED OR PREVENTED BY MADSTONES WHICH THE PIONEER WORE OR CARRIED
SINCE A FALL OR BLOW MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT A COLD PACK WAS USUALLY FIRST AID
BATHING THE ITCHING PARTS WITH KEROSENE GAVE RELIEF AND ALSO KILLED THE PESTS
ANT BITES WERE EASED BY APPLYING LIQUID BLUING
FOR WASP STINGS ONION JUICE OBTAINED BY SCRAPING AN ONION GAVE QUICK RELIEF
A KEROSENE SHAMPOO SEEMS A HEROIC TREATMENT BUT IT DID THE JOB
THE SITUATION INVOLVED SOME POLITICAL PERILS
AND THESE HARDY TRAVELERS ARE NOT UNAPPRECIATED TODAY
SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IN ADVANCE WHETHER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MURDER EXISTED
THEY WERE A VAGABOND LOT AND CONSIDERED TO BE SHADY AND UNDESIRABLE CHARACTERS
HE MET NOBODY HE KNEW ON THIS WALK
HER STUDY OF HISTORY WAS PERSISTENTLY PURSUED
AT DIFFERENT TIMES HE SERVED AS GLEE-CLUB AND CHOIR LEADER AND AS ORGANIST
SHE SERVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WITHOUT PAY BEYOND HER TRAVEL AND MAINTENANCE
BOTH LOVED THE OUT-OF-DOORS INCLUDING MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND HORSEBACK RIDING
YET THEY THRIVED ON IT
NOW THE SCHOOL WAS INDEED BEREFT
SOON THE OFFICE WORK CLAIMED ALL HER TIME
OH HE'LL BE A PLUMBER CAME THE ANSWER
WE PRODUCE PEANUT OIL BUT TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT WE EAT THE ENTIRE SEED
SEEDS OF SOYBEAN COTTON CORN SESAME AND RAPE YIELD SEMIDRYING OILS
PALM OIL PROTECTS THE SURFACES OF STEEL SHEETS BEFORE THEY ARE PLATED WITH TIN
CASTOR OIL MADE FROM CASTORBEANS HAS GONE OUT OF STYLE AS A MEDICINE
QUINCE SEED GUM IS THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN WAVE-SETTING LOTIONS
ALMONDS AND PISTACHIO NUTS ARE NOT SO HIGH IN OIL BUT ARE RICH IN PROTEIN
CHESTNUTS ARE STARCHY
ALL NUT KERNELS ARE RICH IN PROTEIN
THE SO-CALLED VEGETABLE IVORY IS THE HARD ENDOSPERM OF THE EGG-SIZED SEED
FLAXSEED POULTICES AND MUSTARD PLASTERS STILL ARE USED BY SOME PERSONS
BEVERAGES ARE MADE FROM SEEDS THE WORLD OVER
CEREAL GRAINS HAVE BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO PREPARE FERMENTED BEVERAGES
BEER GENERALLY FERMENTED FROM BARLEY IS AN OLD ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE
HAY AND PASTURE ARE THE OTHER CHIEF SOURCES OF LIVESTOCK FEED
TO KEEP 'EM SCATTERED SOMEWHAT AND YET HERD 'EM WAS CALLED LOOSE HERDIN'
TO HOLD 'EM IN A COMPACT MASS WAS CLOSE HERDIN'
CATTLE WHICH DIED FROM THEM WINTER STORMS WERE REFERRED TO AS THE WINTER KILL
THEM NEW TO THE COUNTRY WERE REFERRED TO AS PILGRIMS
THE COWBOY CALLED THIS BREED OF CATTLE MAGPIES
THE COWBOY'S HUMOROUS NAME FOR A COW GIVIN' MILK WAS A MILK PITCHER
COWS GIVIN' NO MILK WERE KNOWED AS STRIPPERS
SUCH AN ANIMAL WAS SAID TO BE MEALYNOSED
AT THE BASE OF THE ROCKY HILLSIDE THEY LEFT THEIR HORSES AND CLIMBED ON FOOT
NICE COUNTRY TO MEET A LION IN FACE TO FACE
CAREFUL DON'T DISTURB HER
EVEN THEN IF SHE TOOK ONE STEP FORWARD HE COULD CATCH HER
BUT NOW SHE SANK LOWER TO THE ROCK
HER TAIL NO LONGER LASHED
BRING ME THE FIRECRACKERS
AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY THOUGH
IT WAS THE STORY OF THE RHINOCEROS FIGHT ALL OVER AGAIN
IF DARK CAME THEY WOULD LOSE HER
SHE SNARLED WARNINGLY
WITH A WHIRLING JUMP IT COULD GET INTO GEAR
THE ANTITHESIS OF THE ECUMENICAL AND THE LOCAL THEN NO LONGER EXISTS
THE REVISED PROCEDURE WAS ACCLAIMED AS A LONG-OVERDUE REFORM
THE COURTYARD IS MAGNIFICENTLY DECORATED
HE HAS NEVER HIMSELF DONE ANYTHING FOR WHICH TO BE HATED  WHICH OF US HAS
NORTHERNERS INDULGE IN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS LUXURY
BRIEF SNIPS OF ACTUAL EVENTS WERE SHOWN PARADES DANCES STREET SCENES
TIME AND SPACE HAVE BOTH BECOME CINEMATIC
NOT SURPRISINGLY THIS APPROACH DID NOT WORK
RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATIONS STRUGGLE TO INSULATE THEMSELVES AGAINST INTRUSIONS
IT OFFERED TO SURRENDER ITS RIGHT TO EXCLUSIVE TRADE BUT ASKED AN INDEMNITY
THESE MEN WERE WITHOUT CAPITAL OR EXPERIENCE
TWENTY-FIVE THE SHEIK REPLIED
THE LIBRARY HAS OPEN SHELVES EVEN IN THE UNBOUND PERIODICAL STOCKROOM
THEY UNDERSTOOD AND TEASED ME A BIT ABOUT IT
BOTH THE CONDITIONS AND THE COMPLICITY ARE DOCUMENTED IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL
NORTHERN LIBERALS ARE THE CHIEF SUPPORTERS OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND OF INTEGRATION
THE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA
WHATEVER THEIR FAULTS THEY ARE NOT HYPOCRITES
A CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY IS IN PROCESS OF ARTICULATION AND ESTABLISHMENT
INTERNAL NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY NOW A TRUISM NEED NOT BE DOCUMENTED
CAN THERMONUCLEAR WAR BE SET OFF BY ACCIDENT
ARE WE AS SAFE AS WE SHOULD BE FROM SUCH A DISASTER
READINESS EXERCISES ARE ALMOST CONTINUOUS
THEY KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEIR MACHINERY BEYOND MECHANICAL DETAILS
THEY INHABIT A SECRET WORLD CENTERED ON GO CODES AND GOLD PHONES
BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY DECIDES TO BREAK IT
VITAL QUESTIONS WOULD BE QUICKLY ANSWERED ACCORDING TO A PREPREPARED AGENDA
NO QUESTION RUFFLES HIM OR CAUSES HIM TO HESITATE
UNLESS WE SEND OUT THE WHOLE PIE THEIR PIECES MEAN NOTHING
ALL THREE MUST COMPARE NOTES AND AGREE TO GO
THEY WERE CHASING A RAIN CLOUD
THEIR GAIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY IN WORDS
ANY ORGANISM THAT FALTERS OR MISPERCEIVES THE SIGNALS OR WEAKENS IS DONE
PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT GIVES THE ABORIGINE HIS ODD AIR OF DIGNITY
DO YOU ALWAYS NAVIGATE LIKE THIS
TWO MILES NORTHEAST THEN FIVE MILES SOUTHWEST  THAT SORT OF THING
THERE WAS ALSO A DOG A DINGO DOG
THEY'LL MOVE AROUND THAT ROCK ALL DAY FOLLOWING THE SHADE
HE GAZED AWAY FROM US AS WE APPROACHED
THERE WAS ALSO A BOOMERANG ELABORATELY CARVED
THE TINY BODIES DROPPED ONTO A DRY LEAF MADE A PILE AS BIG AS A SMALL APPLE
THE ODOR HERE WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT WHICH SURROUNDED THE TOWN ABORIGINES
THE SMELL IS SEXUAL BUT SO POWERFULLY SO THAT A CIVILIZED NOSE MUST DENY IT
BOYS AND MEN GO ALONG THE RIVERBANK OR TO THE ALCOVES IN THE TOP ARCADE
WHEN HE WAS EIGHT HE BEGAN VIOLIN LESSONS
OUR SUCCESSORS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TASK
A NEW ORDER IS THRUSTING ITSELF INTO BEING
THE SYSTEM WORKS AS AN IMPERSONAL MECHANISM
THE THEME MAY BE THE FORMATION OF A SHAPE FROM WHICH OTHER SHAPES EVOLVE
HE MAY TOSS COINS HE MAY TAKE SLIPS OF PAPER FROM A GRAB BAG
THEN THE CHOREOGRAPHER MUST ARBITRATE
HE MUST REARRANGE MATTERS SO THAT TWO PERFORMERS DO NOT BUMP INTO EACH OTHER
ONE WONDERS ABOUT ITS APPLICABILITY TO PEOPLE
PERHAPS THINGS WERE EVEN WORSE THEN
BUT A SOMEWHAT MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS PROCESS MAY BE ILLUMINATING
SOLAR ACTIVITIES COULD PRESUMABLY BRING LONG PERIODS OF FLOOD OR DROUGHT
YET WE NO LONGER FEEL UNEASY
WHAT ELEMENTS OF OUR BEHAVIOR ARE DECISIVE
AMERICAN NEWSPAPER REVIEWERS LIKE TO CALL HIS PLAYS NIHILISTIC
THEY FIND DEEP PESSIMISM IN THEM
HE WORE A BROWN KNIT SPORTS SHIRT WITH NO TIE
HIS TALK TURNS TO WHAT HE CALLS THE MESS OR SOMETIMES THIS BUZZING CONFUSION
ONE CAN ONLY SPEAK OF WHAT IS IN FRONT OF HIM AND THAT NOW IS SIMPLY THE MESS
THIS DOES NOT ALLOW THE MYSTERY TO INVADE US
AS SHE GOES SHE HERSELF WILL BE ILLUMINATED
THEN HE THOUGHT ME MORE PERVERSE THAN EVER
THE BEATNIKS CRAVE A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE IN WHICH THEIR WHOLE BEING PARTICIPATES
THEIR WORK MIRRORS THE MENTALITY OF THE PSYCHOPATH ROOTLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE
THIS GIRL SOON DROPS THE BOURGEOIS PSYCHIATRIST WHO DISAPPROVES OF HER LIFE
WHAT OBSESSIONS HAD SHE PICKED UP DURING THESE LONG NIGHTS OF TALK
EVERYTHING IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS REDUCED ITSELF TO SEXUAL SYMBOLISM
WHAT ONE ACTUALLY REMEMBERS IS ITS GREENNESS
ONE LOOKED DOWN ON A SEA OF LEAVES A BREAKING WAVE OF FLOWER
A WHEEL SQUEAKED ON A HUB WAS STILL AND SQUEAKED AGAIN
THE SEASON BETWEEN SPRING AND SUMMER BELONGS TO LIFE IN ITS CAREFREE ASPECT
HOW DO WE DEFINE IT
WHO WILL SAY THAT OUR COUNTRY IS EVEN NOW A HOMOGENEOUS COMMUNITY
WHETHER HISTORICALLY A FACT OR NOT THE LEGEND HAS A CERTAIN SYMBOLIC VALUE
WHY SHOULD THIS BE SO
HE DID NOT HOWEVER SETTLE BACK INTO ACQUIESCENCE WITH THINGS AS THEY WERE
EACH IS STILL GLORIFIED AS A NATIONAL HERO
HE FINDS IT IN UTTER MISERY AND DESOLATION
AS HE HAD LONGED TO BE HE BECAME THE ECHO OF A SAGA
THE RECORD TEEMS WITH ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE
HIS TOUGH HONESTY CONDEMNS HIM TO A SOLITARY AND DIFFICULT EXISTENCE
IN EITHER CASE THEY DO NOT APPRECIATE THE PRIVATE DETECTIVE'S ZEAL
HIS SUCCESSORS HAVE ADOPTED THE OPPOSITE ALTERNATIVE
THEY ALSO FURNISH PROOF THAT IN MODERN WAR MESSAGE SENDING MUST BE MONITORED
LET ME QUOTE HIM EVEN MORE FULLY FOR HIS ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY THEME
BUT IN EVERY PERIOD IT HAS BEEN HUMANISM
AND LET ME ADD UTOPIANISM ALSO
WE OF THE LIBERAL-LED WORLD GOT ALL SET FOR PEACE AND REHABILITATION
OTHERS INVOKED TECHNOLOGY AND COMMON SENSE
THIS GROUP IS SECULARIST AND THEIR PROGRAM TENDS TO BE TECHNOLOGICAL
SHOULD THE ACCELERATING GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY THEN WARN US
BUT WE CANNOT START OFF WITH A CLEAN SLATE
NO AMOUNT OF BALLYHOO WILL COVER UP THE SORDID FACTS
IT CAN PROJECT LONG-RANGE GOALS FOR ITSELF
INDIVIDUAL HUMAN STRENGTH IS NEEDED TO PIT AGAINST AN INHUMAN CONDITION
HAVE WE NOT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IDEA WORSHIP
WE SCOUR LITERATURE FOR THEM HERE WE FIND STORED THE WISDOM OF GREAT MINDS
HIS NAME BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH COLD-BLOODED CRUELTY
THAT DOCTRINE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY MANY BUT HAS IT PRODUCED GOOD RESULTS
IN TIME SHE PRESENTS HER ARISTOCRATIC HUSBAND WITH A COAL-BLACK CHILD
FALSE IDEAS SURFEIT ANOTHER SECTOR OF OUR LIFE
THE STEPMOTHER ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS A CRUEL OGRESS
RESEARCH INTO SEVERAL CULTURES HAS PROVEN HER POSITION TO BE A MISTAKEN ONE
MOST ASSUREDLY IDEAS ARE INVALUABLE
WE WOULD ESTABLISH NO CENSORSHIP
IRONICALLY ENOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE SUCH PERSONAL VIRTUES WERE A LUXURY
WE KNEW THAT IT WAS AS REASSURANCE THE IRONIC FRUIT OF A DEEPLY MORAL NATURE
CIVILIZATION IS WHAT MAN HAS MADE OF HIMSELF
CHANGE INVOLVES THE DISPLACEMENT OF FORM
THE RESPONSE OF REACTION IS DOMINATED BY A CONCERN FOR WHAT IS VANISHING
WITH THOSE PAINTINGS OF BIG CONSTRUCTIONS CRASHING DOWN HE FELT HE COULD STOP
FOR WHAT DO THE UTOPIANS LABOR
YOU COULD ALSO SAY THAT IN THESE PAMPHLETS IS A RELIEVING QUALITY OF MATURITY
IN AN IDEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT THE PARTICIPANTS TEND TO THUMP THE TABLE
ONLY INCOMPLETE IMPERFECT THINGS MOVE TOWARDS WHAT THEY LACK
HIS PROBLEM CONCERNS LONGITUDES LATITUDES AND ANGULAR VELOCITIES
THIS IS WHAT NECESSITATES THE NONSYSTEMATIC CHARACTER OF HIS ASTRONOMY
BUT CONSIDERED WITHIN TECHNICAL ASTRONOMY A DIFFERENT PATTERN CAN BE TRACED
GEOCENTRICISM PER SE
CUT OFF EVERY BUILDING AT THE SEVENTH FLOOR
NEITHER HIS APPETITES HIS EXACERBATIONS NOR HIS DESPAIR WERE KIN TO YOURS
WITH EACH SONG HE GAVE VERBAL FOOTNOTES
TWO THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO HIS POPULARITY
NO MORE STARTLING CONTRAST TO A SYSTEM OF SULLEN SATELLITES COULD BE IMAGINED
OTHERWISE THE OUTLOOK COULD BE DARK INDEED
THE CONTINUING MODERNIZATION OF THESE FORCES IS A COSTLY BUT NECESSARY PROCESS
IN THE COURSE OF ITS INQUIRY IT TOOK TESTIMONY FROM ONLY SEVEN WITNESSES
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE UNDER A BUSHEL
IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SOPHISTICATED THOUGHT TO GET THE IMPACT OF THIS FACT
THEY DESPISED FOREIGNERS
HE HAS ALSO AN EXTRAORDINARY CONSCIENCE
NOR WERE HIS MANNERS BARBARIC
HE WAS BUSY HE SAID IN HAVING SOMEONE SUBMIT TO A MONKEY-GLAND OPERATION
HE BROUGHT HER SHAWLS
IT HAD A TINY ENVELOPE TIED TO ITS WRIST
DIVERSITY OF PERCEPTION YES DIVERSITY OF FACT YES
TO SOME EXTENT PREDISPOSITIONS ARE SHAPED BY EXPOSURE TO GROUP ENVIRONMENTS
IN SOME MEASURE THEY DEPEND UPON THE STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY
MANY SELECTIONS ARE THEMSELVES CONVINCING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS APPRAISAL
WHAT SHALL THESE EFFECTS BE
WHAT FACTORS CONDITION THE DEGREE OF REALIZATION AT VARIOUS TIMES AND PLACES
PROPERLY USED THE PRESENT BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT INSTRUMENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT
LET US DIFFERENTIATE A FEW OF THESE IDEAS
IT IS THE OBVERSE OF TRIVIALITY SHALLOWNESS EMOTIONAL ANAESTHESIA
THERE RESULTS A STUDY OF LITERATURE FREED FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE CONTEMPORARY
HIS TECHNIQUE IS GENUINELY MASTERFUL
QUESTIONS CAME TO ME FROM ALL SIDES ABOUT MY WORLD CITIZENSHIP ACTIVITIES
HE ADVISED IMMEDIATE HOSPITALIZATION
MAYBE THEY WILL TAKE US
EIGHT FIELD GUNS WERE CAPTURED IN POSITION
NEXT BEST TO DESTROYING AN ARMY IS TO DEPRIVE IT OF ITS FREEDOM OF ACTION
ALL CHANCE OF FULFILLING MY DESTINY IS OVER
SO OF COURSE HE STAYED PUT
HE HAD COLLARED ONE OF HIS GENERALS IN PUBLIC
WOE BETIDE THE INTERVIEWEE IF HE ANSWERED VAGUELY
PASSING DOGS WERE GREETED WITH A CORDIAL BARK
HE HAD ACCORDINGLY CULTIVATED ECCENTRICITY TO THE POINT OF SECOND NATURE
TRANSPARENT LOOK WAXY SKIN  COULD WELL BE UREMIA
IT IS AWE-INSPIRING
THEY CLOSE SOMETIME AFTER EIGHT
LET HIM BECOME HONEST AND THEY DISCARD HIM
WE HOPE THAT HE WILL EXECUTE IT IN A MANNER THAT WILL ENTITLE HIM TO CREDIT
HIS ARTISTIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS GUARANTEED HIM ENTRY INTO ANY SOCIAL GATHERING
INSTEAD OF THAT HE WAS ENGULFED BY BEDLAM
THE PURCHASERS REJECTED THE ORDER IN TWO LETTERS WRITTEN IN VIGOROUS TERMS
BUT WE AREN'T GOING TO LET YOU GIVE HIM ANY
ALL ABOUT HIM STOOD TOMBSTONES HIS OWN SENSITIVE GREAT HANDS HAD FASHIONED
BUT THEY WOULD RECONSIDER IT THEY ASSURED HIM IF HE WOULD REWRITE IT
THIS DOCTRINE WAS REPUGNANT TO MY MORAL SENSE
IF DISOBEYED THE RESULT IS TURMOIL AND CHAOS
AS WE OBSERVE MORAL LAW AND PHYSICAL LAW THEY APPEAR AS BEING INEVITABLE
THEIR BASIS SEEMS DEEPER THAN MERE AUTHORITY
THEY ARE NOT TRUE BECAUSE SCIENTISTS OR PROPHETS SAY THEY ARE TRUE
MY OWN EXPERIENCE HAS FOLLOWED SIMPLER LINES
RELIGION THUS BECOMES INTEGRATED WITH LIFE
THIS TRUTH THAT THE MORAL LAW IS NATURAL HAS OTHER IMPORTANT COROLLARIES
LET US NOW GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THE SOUL
ONLY THOSE STORY TELLERS WILL REMAIN WHO CAN IMITATE THE STYLE OF THE VIRTUOUS
POETS MOREOVER DWELL ON HUMAN PASSIONS
STUDENTS' CHOICES OF IDEAL EDUCATIONAL GOALS ARE NOT ARBITRARY OR WHIMSICAL
THEY ALSO WANT MONEY PRESTIGE AND SECURITY
CONSERVATISM AND TRADITIONALISM SEEM IMPLIED BY WHAT HAS JUST BEEN SAID
AVOWED ATHEISTS OR FREETHINKERS ARE SO RARE AS TO BE A CURIOSITY
THE REDCOATS RAN LIKE RABBITS
THIS IS NEVERTHELESS A MINORITY VIEW
THE TRAGIC STAGE IS A PLATFORM EXTENDING PRECARIOUSLY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL
THE WHEEL OF SOCIAL LIFE SPUN AROUND THE ROYAL OR ARISTOCRATIC CENTRE
FROM IT SPOKES OF ORDER AND DEGREE LED TO THE OUTWARD RIM OF THE COMMON MAN
TRAGEDY PRESUMES SUCH A CONFIGURATION
ITS SPHERE IS THAT OF ROYAL COURTS DYNASTIC QUARRELS AND VAULTING AMBITIONS
PRINCES AND FACTIONS CLASHED IN THE OPEN STREET AND DIED ON THE OPEN SCAFFOLD
AND THEIR CHRONICLERS ARE NOT THE DRAMATIC POETS BUT THE PROSE NOVELISTS
THEY WERE NOT YET PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT AS IRREMEDIABLE
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THAT MOST EVIDENCE POINTS TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION
BUT NONE OF THIS COULD SOOTHE THE EXACERBATED NERVES
WE OFTEN SAY OF A PERSON THAT HE LOOKS YOUNG FOR HIS AGE OR OLD FOR HIS AGE
BOY YOU AIN'T FOOLING NOBODY BUT YOURSELF
WE MAY SAY OF SOME UNFORTUNATES THAT THEY WERE NEVER YOUNG
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU MANAGE IT
THUS FAR THE ADVANCES MADE HAVE BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY ALONG FUNCTIONAL LINES
HE IS FORCED TO PLAY FOR LITTLE MONEY AND MUST OFTEN TAKE ANOTHER JOB TO LIVE
IN MANY OF HIS POEMS DEATH COMES BY TRAIN A STRONGLY EVOCATIVE VISUAL IMAGE
BUT IT DID PRINT GOOD VERSE AND GOOD FICTION
IDEAS ARE THE THRUWAY TO NOWHERE
THE SCULPTOR LOOKED AT HIM BUGEYED AND AMAZED ANGRY
OBJECT  A VILLAGE CROSSROADS
HE WAS THUS AN EARLY AND SPECTACULAR VICTIM
NO POETRY NO AIRPLANES NO DANCERS
THE TROUBLE IS THAT LIKE MANY SYMBOLS IT DOESN'T SEEM A VERY REALISTIC ONE
MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY
EVIDENCE THAT OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE UNAVAILABLE MUST BE PROVIDED
ONLY RARELY IS ATTENTION GIVEN TO ACCURATE PROGRESS REPORTS AND EVALUATION
DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES A LONG-TERM APPROACH
MOST OF OUR AID WILL GO TO THOSE NEARING SELF-SUFFICIENCY
TO HONOR HIM IS TO HONOR OURSELVES
MY SINCERE WISH IS THAT HE CONTINUES TO ADD TO THIS RECORD HE SETS HERE TODAY
ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES
FORTY-SEVEN STATES ASSIGN OR PROVIDE VEHICLES FOR EMPLOYEES ON STATE BUSINESS
IT DOES NOT INDICATE LOOSE MANAGEMENT INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS OR POOR POLICY
FROM THIS MOTOR POOL PERSONNEL DEVELOP OTHER MEANINGFUL AND RELATED DATA
UNIT PRICES FOR STATE VEHICLES ARE INVARIABLY LOWER THAN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC
IN TWO CASES AIRPLANES ONLY WERE INDICATED
TEN OTHERS MADE NO REPLY
BOTH HAVE EXCELLENT INTEGRATION OF THEIR FISCAL TAX COLLECTION YEAR CALENDARS
DANCES ALTERNATED WITH SUNG OR SPOKEN VERSES
BALLETS WERE USED IN OPERA FROM ITS BEGINNING
TWENTY-NINE EXHIBITS RECEIVED AWARDS
THIRTY-FIVE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN STUDENTS RECEIVED LABORATORY TRAINING
THE SHUTTER CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS A FAST-OPENING PART AND A FAST-CLOSING PART
RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS
VAPOR PRESSURE METHOD
THIS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO HELIUM FILM FLOW IN THE VAPOR PRESSURE THERMOMETER
LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS
SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND TABLES OF AVAILABLE DATA ARE NOW IN PREPARATION
ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS
BLOCKADE IS ONE ANSWER OFFERED BY EXPERTS
LAND-BASED RADAR WOULD HELP WITH THIS TASK
SO WOULD RADAR PICKET SHIPS
SOLID CONCRETE BLOCKS RELATIVELY HEAVY AND DENSE ARE USED FOR THIS SHELTER
BRICKS ARE AN ALTERNATIVE
THE SHELTER SHOWN WOULD PROVIDE ALMOST ABSOLUTE FALLOUT PROTECTION
THE SAME SHELTER COULD BE BUILT INTO AN EMBANKMENT OR BELOW GROUND LEVEL
RADIO RECEPTION IS CUT DOWN BY THE SHIELDING NECESSARY TO KEEP OUT RADIATION
LIVING IN A SHELTER THE RADIOACTIVITY OF FALLOUT DECAYS RAPIDLY AT FIRST
A BATTERY-POWERED RADIO IS ESSENTIAL
FAMILY RATIONING PROBABLY WILL BE NECESSARY
BLOWERS SHOULD BE OPERATED PERIODICALLY ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE
A COVERED CONTAINER SUCH AS A KITCHEN GARBAGE PAIL MIGHT DO AS A TOILET
A PORTABLE ELECTRIC HEATER IS ADVISABLE FOR SHELTERS IN COLD CLIMATES
A FLAME WOULD USE UP AIR
ONE OF THESE IS THE SOLIDARITY AND THE CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP OF MARRIAGE
THEY SHOULD LIVE IN MODEST CIRCUMSTANCES AVOIDING ALL CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
OUR AIM MUST BE TO LEARN AS MUCH AS WE TEACH
THESE CURVES WERE DERIVED BY AN ANALYSIS OF EXTENSIVE SKYWAVE MEASUREMENT DATA
IF YOU ARE A LIFE TENANT YOU DEDUCT ALLOWABLE DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION
HE MAY GET A TAX REFUND
FURTHER RESEARCH WE BELIEVE WILL DEVELOP IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
AT INTERVALS AN ALUMNI DIRECTORY IS ISSUED
BETWEEN MEETINGS HE HELPS THE PRESIDENT KEEP TRACK OF DELEGATED MATTERS
HOW WELL DO FACULTY MEMBERS GOVERN THEMSELVES
HE CAN FOR EXAMPLE PRESENT SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSITY-WIDE ISSUES TO THE SENATE
DEANS CAN FORM AN IMPORTANT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FACULTY
MORE OFTEN THESE OFFICES ARE RESTRICTED TO THE GATHERING OF EMPIRICAL DATA
A DETAILED STUDY OF THIS LATTER PHENOMENON WAS NOT ATTEMPTED IN THIS PAPER
IT WAS EXPOSED TO A HIGH VELOCITY GAS JET
IF THEY ARE NOT ELLIPSOIDS THE CONCLUSIONS WILL BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION
THIS VISCOSITY OF THE MATERIAL IN THE DROPS IS OF COURSE NOT NEGLIGIBLE
THIS IS KNOWN AS CONFORMATIONAL ENTROPY
INDEED IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC FROM NUCLEAR EFFECTS
THE BETTER QUALITY PRODUCTS IN BOTH OF THESE LINES CONTAIN PHOSPHATE BUILDERS
MANY SCOURING POWDERS NOW ALSO CONTAIN PHOSPHATES
SOIL REDEPOSITION IS EVALUATED BY WASHING CLEAN SWATCHES WITH THE DIRTY ONES
IN MOST CASES THESE SOILS ARE TAKEN UP AS LIQUIDS THROUGH CAPILLARY ACTION
CLEANED CLOTH MUST BE PROTECTED AGAINST THE REDEPOSITION OF DISPERSED SOIL
THE PHOTOCHEMICAL EXCHANGE IN THE GAS PHASE
THERE ARE SEVERAL SOURCES OF EVIDENCE ON THE MICROMETEORITE ENVIRONMENT
SPACE PROBES HAVE YIELDED LITTLE INFORMATION
BEING BASED ON SO FEW EVENTS THESE RESULTS ARE OF DUBIOUS VALIDITY
TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH LOW DENSITY APPLIES TO MICROMETEORITES IS UNKNOWN
BIOLOGICAL WARFARE IS CONSIDERED TO BE PRIMARILY A STRATEGIC WEAPON
THIS AREA IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION
THERE ARE OPTIMAL HUMIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIOUS AGENTS WHEN AIRBORNE
THIS MAY BE OF OVERRIDING IMPORTANCE IN CONSIDERING MILITARY OBJECTIVES
LOUSINESS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR EPIDEMIC TYPHUS
IT IS A HAPPY BUZZING CROWD
QUITE OFTEN HONEYBEES FORM A MAJORITY ON THE WILLOW CATKINS
THE LARVAE KEPT WARM BY THE QUEEN ARE FULL GROWN IN ABOUT TEN DAYS
SOMETIMES ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS ALWAYS THESE ARE INDEED ALKALINE
IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A FEW GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT THE SIX GIANTS THEMSELVES
THIS BIRTH LENGTH SEEMS TO BE TYPICAL
THE LOWER PORTION PROVIDES A RATING AT ANY STAGE BETWEEN INFANCY AND ADULTHOOD
NO FASCICULATIONS OR SENSORY DEFECTS WERE FOUND
THYROID FUNCTION TESTS YIELDED NORMAL RESULTS
X-RAY FILMS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN SHOWED PROGRESSION OF THE DEMINERALIZATION
MICROSCOPICALLY THERE WAS EMPHYSEMA FIBROSIS AND VASCULAR CONGESTION
INFLAMMATORY CELLS WERE STRIKINGLY ABSENT
THESE WERE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT REGENERATING FIBERS
THIS WAS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THE BLUISH WHITE AUTOFLUORESCENCE FROM THE CELLS
NO ANTIGEN WAS DETECTABLE IN CERTAIN DARK SPHERICAL AREAS IN MOST CELLS
OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE STUDY OF THE ACTIONS OF DRUGS IN THIS RESPECT
THE SHOCK THERAPIES ACT LIKEWISE ON THE HYPOTHALAMIC BALANCE
MARKSMANSHIP EXAMPLE
BEFORE DERIVING THIS FORMULA WE EXPLAIN WHAT WE MEAN BY PROBLEMS OF THIS KIND
WE NOW GENERALIZE THESE IDEAS FOR GENERAL BINOMIAL EXPERIMENTS
EXPERIMENT WITHOUT A FIXED NUMBER OF TRIALS
TOSS A DIE UNTIL AN ACE APPEARS
CONSIDER COUPLES VISITING AN ART MUSEUM
AGAIN THE ANALYTICITY OF THE TWO CURVES GUARANTEES THAT SUCH INTERVALS EXIST
THE UNIVERSE IS A SAFE AND PERMANENT HOME
THIS EXPLAINS SOME GROUP ENDS AND PROVIDES A JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR PRIMACY
IT GIVES SOCIAL GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION AND MAKES FOR PROGRAMS OF SOCIAL ACTION
RELIGION FOSTERS GROUP LIFE IN VARIOUS WAYS
AS SUCH IT ACTS AS AN ANCHOR FOR THE PEOPLE
THESE NEEDS USUALLY CONCERN THE REDUCTION OF GUILT AND SOME RELIEF OF TENSION
WITHIN THE LARGER SOCIAL SYSTEM ARE THE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL SUBSYSTEMS
REGULATIVE NORMS GOVERNING SUBGROUPS AND ROLES
THE PROBLEM OF SOLIDARITY AND MORALE AGAIN INVOLVES THE CONCEPT OF VALUES
THE POPULATION CAN THEREBY REPLENISH ITSELF AND ACTUALLY GROW LARGER
BUT THE INFORMATION ON THE DYNAMICS OF POPULATION WAS OFTEN QUITE MISLEADING
IN SHORT SCIENTIFIC SAMPLING WAS INTRODUCED IN PLACE OF SUBJECTIVE SAMPLING
IT PROVIDES A FRAME FOR THE SAMPLING CENSUS
BUT IN THIS ONE SECTION WE WELCOMED AUDITORS
AFTER THAT WE BEGAN TO GET VISITORS TO CLASS
SOME OF THESE SPECULATIONS MAY HAVE SOME MERIT OTHERS ARE SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS
BUT WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK HE ALLOWED FOR AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE
OR HOW DO WE ENRICH OUR ALREADY FINE MARRIAGE
OUR CAMPUS UNFORTUNATELY OWNS NO FILMS
THE BATTERY MEDIAN GRADE-EQUIVALENT WAS USED IN DATA ANALYSIS IN THIS STUDY
THE BATTING AVERAGE OF ONE SUCCESS OUT OF SEVEN INCREASED TO ONE OUT OF THREE
HE ADMITTED HIS BEHAVIOR AND DEFENDED IT
WE MAY SAY THAT HIS PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED BUT THAT HE REFUSED TREATMENT
TO USE THESE NEW WAYS IN DAILY LIFE IS THE LAST STEP
ROLEPLAYING USED FOR ANALYSIS FOLLOWS THESE GENERAL STEPS LEADING TO TRAINING
EACH FORM REPRESENTED BY THE DICTIONARY IS LOOKED UP IN THE TEXT-FORM LIST
THIS LEAVES THE ORDERING OF ENTRIES VARIABLE
OFTEN DOMINANT STRESS SIMPLY INDICATES A CENTERING OF ATTENTION OR EMOTION
SOMETIMES STRONG STRESS SERVES TO FOCUS AN IMPORTANT SECONDARY RELATIONSHIP
AS THESE MALADIES OVERLAP SO MUST THE CURE
MORPHOPHONEMIC RULES MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS JOINING CERTAIN POINTS IN THE SYSTEM
YOU WOULD DRIVE US INTO SHAME HE DECLARED
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
BUT BRIEFLY THE TOPPING CONFIGURATION MUST BE EXAMINED FOR ITS INFERENCES
THEY ARE BOTH TREND-FOLLOWING METHODS
HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY PROFITS COULD A MAJORITY TAKE OUT OF THE LOSSES OF A FEW
THERE NEED BE NO SQUEAMISHNESS ABOUT ADMITTING THIS
MARKETS SHOULD BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE AS CONSUMERS BECOME MORE SELECTIVE
IN WAGE NEGOTIATIONS THE INDUSTRY BARGAINS AS A UNIT WITH A SINGLE UNION
SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CHANGE
SUCH LEGISLATION WAS CLARIFIED AND EXTENDED FROM TIME TO TIME THEREAFTER
A CLEARLY RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION IS A STATUTORY MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION
IT IS NOT A PLEASANT OR EASY POSITION BUT ONE WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAINTAIN
HOWEVER WHEN LABOR DISPUTES ARISE ITS PROVISIONS COME CLEARLY INTO PLAY
ASSUME FOR EXAMPLE A SITUATION WHERE A FARM HAS A PACKING SHED AND FIELDS
THERE IS NO DISPUTE INVOLVING FIELDWORK
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ISSUE ARE ENORMOUS
THE ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL CHILD GROWS GRADUALLY IN HIS ABILITY TO WORK IN GROUPS
TEACHER ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER TO DESEGREGATE
THE PLAINTIFF IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASES
DO THEY MAKE CLASS-BIASED DECISIONS
DOES SOCIETY REALLY EXIST AS AN ENTITY OVER AND ABOVE THE AGGLOMERATION OF MEN
NOW THAT THIS IS AT ODDS WITH OUR MEANING MAY BE SHOWN AS FOLLOWS
HE HOLDS THAT GOODNESS AND BADNESS LIE IN FEELINGS OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL
WE DO NOT ARRIVE AT SPATIAL IMAGES BY MEANS OF THE SENSE OF TOUCH BY ITSELF
IN WHAT WAYS THEN DID THE PATIENT'S PSYCHICAL BLINDNESS MANIFEST ITSELF
THINKING THE EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO GET A CONVICTION HE LATER RELEASED HIM
AND THE LAW VIRTUALLY IGNORED THE SITUATION
RECEIVING NO ANSWER THEY SET THE FIRE
WITHIN A MONTH CALLS WERE UP SEVENTY PER CENT
YET ONE HAS TO GO BACK ONLY SOME SIXTY YEARS
SURELY THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT COMMUNISM
WE WILL ACHIEVE A MORE VIVID SENSE OF WHAT IT IS BY REALIZING WHAT IT IS NOT
RESOLVED THAT THE ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENT IS BECOMING RIPE FOR RESOLUTE ACTION
AND THE SURFACE IS DRIVEN BACK IN ITS VERY SURFACENESS ONLY BY THIS CONTRAST
IN MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THIS PHENOMENON THE FIGURES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY INFLATED
HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM
A SECOND ASSISTANT MOPPED WITH TWO SPONGES
NECESSARY RETOUCHING WAS PUT ON AT ONCE
THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON TO MISINTERPRET OR IGNORE THE INTENT OF THIS LETTER
PERSONAL PREDISPOSITIONS TEND TO BLUNT THE EAR AND IN TURN THE VOICE AS WELL
THE FAILURE TO KEEP THESE TWO USAGES DISTINCT PRESENTS HAZARDS TO THE READER
THIS IS NO ASSIGNMENT FOR A FRIVOLOUS GIRL SHE ASSURES HIM
THOUGH BRIEF IT HAS A SHARP DRAMATIC EDGE AND GREAT POIGNANCY
THERE ARE MANY SUCH COMPETENTLY ANONYMOUS PERFORMANCES AMONG THE EARLIER POEMS
ABOUT DAWN HE GOT UP TO BLOW
IT HAD ASSUMED THE TERRIFYING INERTIA OF INANIMATE MATTER
THEY WERE BOTH VERY FLUENT
HIS SINUOUS MELODY IS A SORT OF NAIVE TRANSCENDENCE OF ALL EXPERIENCE
CONFABULATION HAS COME TO DETERMINE STRUCTURE
INDEX WORDS AND ELECTRONIC SWITCHES MAY BE RESERVED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS
WITH THE SPRING RAINS THE FLOW ROSE RAPIDLY DUE TO INFILTRATION IN OPEN SEWERS
AT NO TIME WERE ALGAE FOUND IN THE MIXED LIQUOR
THE BACTERIA FORMED TYPICAL ACTIVATED SLUDGE FLOC
NOW THE PROBLEM IS PRESENTED PIECEMEAL AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORILY
WHILE ONE ELEMENT IS ANNOUNCING PROGRESS ANOTHER IS DELINEATING ITS PROBLEMS
CONCEIVABLY THE SUBMARINE DEFENSE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY SUFFICIENT FORCES
THE WORLD IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING WHAT WAS NEW YESTERDAY IS OBSOLESCENT TODAY
BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE PLAN SHOULD NOT BE ORIENTED GEOGRAPHICALLY
A CONCURRENT EFFORT IS NEEDED TO MAKE OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA USEFUL ON THE SPOT
THESE ALWAYS CONTAIN METALLIC INCLUSIONS
SIMPLE ELONGATION HAS BEEN TREATED IN DETAIL
A THIRD VOLUME REMAINS TO BE PUBLISHED
OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTY VALUES ARE ALSO GIVEN
THE DATA ARE PRESENTED IN LISTS AND TABLES
THE COMPOUNDS ARE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO COMPOSITION INTO SEVEN CATEGORIES
SUBSTANCES ALL CRYSTALLINE SUBSTANCES AND OTHER SOLID-STATE MATERIALS
COVERAGE OF PRIMARY LITERATURE WILL FOLLOW
IN EARLIER YEARS THE PRESERVATION OF FOOD WAS ESSENTIALLY RELATED TO SURVIVAL
MICROORGANISMS ARE OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RAPID SPOILAGE OF FOODS
IT WILL HOWEVER INHIBIT THE SPROUTING OF POTATOES AND OTHER ROOT VEGETABLES
CHIEF INTEREST IN RADIOSTERILIZATION RESIDES IN THE MILITARY SERVICES
MEATS THE RADIATION PROCESSING OF MEAT HAS RECEIVED EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION
TO DATE THE ONE MEAT SHOWING FAVORABLE RESULTS AT STERILIZATION DOSES IS PORK
POULTRY RESULTS OF IRRADIATION TESTS WITH POULTRY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL
URETHANE FOAM AS AN INSULATOR IS ALSO COMING IN FOR A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION
ORIGINALLY THE MAIN TYPES USED WERE VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS OF POLYESTERS
THE SINGLE CURVE LINE REPRESENTS A SPECIFIC FORMULATION IN A TEST EXAMPLE
THESE AIR OR GAS BUBBLES MAKE HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL THERMAL BARRIERS
THE MIXING HEAD MOVES BACK AND FORTH SLOWLY ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE RECEPTACLE
A DOMESTIC AUTOMATIC WASHER THAT WILL GIVE EQUIVALENT RESULTS MAY BE USED
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR KNITTED FABRICS
THE ELECTRON OPTICAL SYSTEM MAY BE EITHER A MAGNETIC OR ELECTROSTATIC ONE
MEASURED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS FOR THIS EXPERIMENTAL TUBE WILL BE LISTED
SPACE CHARGE INFLUENCES WILL ALSO DECREASE AT INCREASED VOLTAGES
WE CAN HOWEVER MAXIMIZE ITS EXPECTED VALUE
MANUAL LEVELING REQUIRES AN APPROPRIATE DISPLAY OF THE ACCELEROMETER OUTPUTS
THIS PROCESS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT SINCE GYRO DRIFTING IS TYPICALLY RANDOM
IN SIMPLER TERMS IT AMOUNTS TO POINTING THE PLATFORM IN THE PROPER DIRECTION
THE PLATFORM ACCELEROMETERS MUST BE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED FOR THIS PROCEDURE
A PRECISION TRANSIT IS SET UP SO THAT IT IS ALIGNED WITH RESPECT TO TRUE NORTH
THIS CAN BE DONE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY BY EXISTING SURVEYING TECHNIQUES
GYROCOMPASS HEADING
HE LOOKED LAZY SPOILED A LITTLE QUERULOUS
SHE GREETED HER HUSBAND'S COLLEAGUES WITH SMILING POLITENESS OFFERING NOTHING
YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH HONEY
HUSKY YOUNG MAN HE SAID WITH MOCK DISTASTE
IS HIS APPETITE IMPROVED
OR DOES HE GET EXERCISE
IT REQUIRED AN ENERGY HE NO LONGER POSSESSED TO BE SATIRICAL ABOUT HIS FATHER
HE DID NOT MIND THE USELESS KINDLY QUESTIONS
HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH BLANKETS
CLOSER STILL REGULAR BARRICADES OF BARBED WIRE HUNG ON TIMBER SUPPORTS
WAS IT ALL VAIN LABOR
IT COULD TAKE PLACE TOMORROW NIGHT OR IT MIGHT OCCUR MONTHS FROM NOW
GIVE ME YOUR MACHINE GUN AMMO
THEY ARE ALSO HONEST SEEKERS AFTER TRUTH
THE OTHER PATRONS WERE TAXI DRIVERS AND ART STUDENTS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS
THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT JUST DIDN'T BOTHER HIM
THESE WERE HEROES NINE FEET TALL TO HIM
POVERTY IMPOSES A KIND OF CHASTITY ON THE AMBITIOUS
AT LAW SCHOOL THE SAME
PERHAPS IT WAS RIGHT PERHAPS IT WAS JUST
HE MERELY SAID ANY GOOD DECORATOR THESE DAYS CAN MAKE YOU A TASTEFUL HOME
THERE WAS TYPHOID AND MALARIA
BY THAT TIME PERHAPS SOMETHING BETTER CAN BE DONE
HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
TWO GAS LAMPS WERE NO MORE THAN A MISLEADING GLOW
AFTER THAT VIOLENCE WAS EXULTANTLY EASY
FROM CHILDHOOD HE HAD KNOWN ALL ABOUT KNIVES
HE SMASHED IT IN AND TUMBLED INTO DARKNESS
IT WAS LIKE FINALLY GETTING INTO ONE'S OWN NIGHTMARES TO PUNISH ONE'S DREAMS
YET EVEN THAT EXPLOSION DID NOT MEAN MUCH
BEHIND HIM BILLOWED A SMALL PUNGENT CLOUD OF SMOKE
IT WAS NOT EXACTLY PANIC THEY GAVE WAY TO BUT THEY COULD NOT JUST SIT THERE
BY THE LOOK OF HIM HE WASN'T THAT FAR GONE
FOR A MOMENT BOY AND MOUNT HUNG IN MIDAIR
THE BLOW ENCOUNTERED SILKY HAIR AND HARD BONE
THEY WERE PURSUING HIM
THE WALLS BULGED THE FLOOR TREMBLED THE WINDOWPANES RATTLED
HE STARED AT THE FAR MORNING EXPECTING A PENDULUM TO SWING ACROSS THE HORIZON
HOWEVER A BOY'S LIVELY EYES MIGHT ROVE
A FLASH ILLUMINED THE TREES AS A CROOKED BOLT TWIGGED IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS
FIDDLES SCREECHED A PIANO TINKLED
THEY STAYED AT HOTELS AND BOARDINGHOUSES OR AT PRIVATE HOMES
HE CHUCKLED THE MEMORY VIVID
MAYBE THEY'LL STOP IT NOW ONCE FOR ALL
THEY'RE DOIN' IT NOW
THE WORD ALSO MADE HIM FEEL HATE SINCERE HATE FOR THOSE SO LABELED
HIRED HARD LACKEYS OF THE WARMONGERING CAPITALISTS
HIS ARM MOVED SWIFTLY VIOLENTLY ONCE TWICE
THE THOUGHT CAME BACK THE ONE NAGGING AT HIM THESE PAST FOUR DAYS
SOMEBODY'LL HAFTA START THINKIN
HE LOOKED OVER AT HIM LYING THERE ASLEEP AND HE FELT A WAVE OF REVULSION
WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE DUMPED HIM OFF ON SOMEONE ELSE
THOROUGHLY WISED UP
KNOWS THE SCORE WITH A SUPREME EFFORT HE BROKE IT OFF
MAYBE THEY ALREADY GOT THEM
BOY YOU'RE STIRRIN EARLY A SLEEPY VOICE SAID
THEY'LL TOE THE LINE
SEE HE'S ALREADY SNAPPING IT UP THE DUMB JERK
MERELY TO SATISFY THE AUTHOR'S CURIOSITY
NO ONE WILL EVEN SUSPECT THAT IT IS YOUR WORK
WHO IS GOING TO STOP ME
NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE
AT HOME YES THEY ARGUED
IS IT BECAUSE OF MY SLOVENLINESS THAT HAIR GROWS ON MY FACE
HE TREMBLED LEST HIS PIECE SHOULD FAIL
DRUNKENNESS WAS NO LONGER TOLERATED
IT WOULD BE WELL TO SHOW THE POPULACE HOW WE DEAL WITH ADULTERERS
A CARRIAGE CRUNCHED BY ITS DIM LIGHTS FILTERING THROUGH THE GLOOM
FISTS PUMMELED HIM AS HE STAGGERED FORWARD
HE WONDERED IF IT WORE THE OLD ANXIETY OR THE OLD TAUT STOICISM
IT GAVE THE RUBBERIZED FABRIC A DULL GLEAM LIKE METAL
THE FEET WORE ARMY SHOES IN OBVIOUS DISREPAIR
THEN HE  THEN WHAT
HE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO THEY WERE OR KNOW THEIR OWN WORTH
IN THE PITY FOR THEM HIS LONELINESS WAS GONE
IT IS THE SAME OLE SAME TELL ME ITS NAME
Y'ALL WANNA WALK  WALK HE SAID
Y'ALL SHOULD HAVE LET ME DO IT
MAYBE TODAY'LL BE A GOOD-NEWS DAY
OH  WE MANAGED SHE SAID
OUTSIDE ONLY A HANDFUL OF REPORTERS REMAINED
HOWEVER THE LITTER REMAINED AUGMENTED BY SEVERAL DOZEN LUNCHROOM SUPPERS
THEY OFFERED NO OPINIONS VOLUNTEERED NOTHING BETRAYED NO EMOTIONS
A SLEEPY VOICE ANSWERED
HE WAITED UNTIL THEY WERE INSIDE THE ELEVATOR AND THEN SAID NOW WHAT DO WE DO
THEY HAD VERMOUTH SITTING IN FRONT OF A CAFE
HE REACHED OUT AND FELT THE BATH TOWEL HANGING ON THE TOWEL RACK OVER THE TUB
VISUALLY THESE APPROXIMATED WHAT HE WAS FEELING WITHIN HIMSELF
LEAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS
THE SURGEON CARRIED A CAGE OF LIVE PIGEONS
WAS IT A BIRTHDAY BALL
IT WAS A GROTESQUE HEN FIVE OR SIX FEET TALL
HUSBANDRY WAS BOUNDED BY SNAKE-RAIL FENCES AND THERE WERE GRAZING CATTLE
THEY OFTEN THREW TIDBITS OVERBOARD
ONE HAD TO BELIEVE IN FINAL EVENTS OR ONE WAS STRANDED IN THE ABYSS OF NOTHING
HE DROVE SENSUAL PATTERNS OFF CAREFULLY SHAVING HIS LONG UPPER LIP
HE BEGAN TO PACK THE SADDLEBAGS
THIS IS OUR SINGULAR GOAL
ANDREI'S SKILLED EYE SIZED THEM UP
ICE BATHS ELECTRIC SHOCKS LASHINGS WILD DOGS TESTICLE CRUSHERS
HE FOUND AN EMPTY BENCH OPENED A NEWSPAPER AND STRETCHED HIS LEGS BEFORE HIM
HIS CAPTAIN WAS THIN AND HAGGARD AND HIS BEAUTIFUL BOOTS WERE WORN AND SHABBY
FLIES SWARMED AROUND THE BOWL OF LENTILS IN WHICH HE MOPPED THICK BLACK BREAD
SUDDENLY SHE WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS AND DRAMATIC
WE BOTH HAD HANGOVERS
BROWN EYES EYEBROW MUSTACHE
OVAL FACE WITHOUT AN EXPRESSION IN THE WORLD
EXBOYFRIEND MEET EXHUSBAND
HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY IN HIS POCKET
HOW ABOUT ME TRYING TO HELP HER GET HER JOB BACK
THEY WEREN'T AS WELL PAID AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
FOR ONCE RADICALISM WAS A RECOMMENDATION
RECTOR WAS OFTEN CURIOUS OFTEN TEMPTED TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT HE NEVER DID
HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE PRESENT TODAY
YOUR VOICE IS DELIGHTFUL HE APPROVED WITH A WARM SMILE
THE JADED AMORIST CONJURED UP PICTURES OF THE BLASPHEMOUS RITES WITH RELISH
TO BE PASSIVE TO BE GIRLISHLY SHY WAS PALPABLY ABSURD
NO SHE WOULD NOT PRETEND MODESTY BUT NEITHER MUST SHE BE CRUDELY BOLD
WITH HIS CLUB FOOT HE MIGHT WELL BE GRATEFUL
HER LIPS MOIST AND PARTED SPOKE HIS NAME
SHE SPRANG UP AND WENT SWIFTLY TO THE BEDROOM
NEITHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE GIFT
ON ALL SIDES DOORS WERE BEING SLAMMED IN HIS FACE
A CRUDE LADDER RAN DOWN TO A WOODEN FLOOR
PROMPTED BY A GUILTY URGE HE HAD DISOBEYED THE ORDER OF A MAN HE RESPECTED
THE FIGURE IN THE CORNER BELCHED LOUDLY A DEEP LIQUID ERUPTION
THE FLAT-BOTTOMED BOAT SWUNG SLOWLY TO THE PULL OF THE CURRENT
THEY MOVED TOWARD THE SKIFFS WITH SHOCKING EAGERNESS ELBOWING AND SHOVING
THE THIRD CRAWLING MAN FORCED HIMSELF ERECT
TWO CLOTTED BALLS THE COLOR OF MUCUS ROLLED BETWEEN FIERY LIDS
HIS SWEET WHISPER CAME AFTER GREAT EFFORT
INTELLIGENCE JABBED AT HIM ACCUSINGLY
HE BELIEVED THAT BRAVE BOYS DIDN'T CRY
NOBODY DOES BUT THEY GAVE ME TEN LAST YEAR
INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS HE SHOUTED HEARTILY
HE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD
SHE SMILED AND THE TEETH GLEAMED IN HER BEAUTIFULLY MODELED OLIVE FACE
THE NAME FELL WITH LAZY AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE FROM HER LIPS
FOR AN INSTANT THE OLD AUNT FELT SOMETHING INDEFINABLE FLASH THROUGH HER SMILE
THAT IS WHAT CHILDHOOD IS HE TOLD HIMSELF
THEY'VE NEVER MET YOU KNOW
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM MAD ENOUGH IF HE WAS SOBER
THIS KID'S FROZE BAD
PA DON'T CARE ABOUT THE KID
HE DIDN'T FIGURE HER AT ALL AND IF HE FOUND OUT A WOMAN IT'D BE BAD
HEAT'S BAD FOR FROSTBITE
HE'S GOT TO THAW SLOW
LIFT DON'T SHOVE LIFT
HIS HEAD FLOPPED BACK
NOW HE'LL CHOKE FOR SURE
SHE KNEW SHE WAS FEELING AFRAID AND INWARDLY LAUGHED AT HERSELF
THERE WAS MUCH EMBRACING MUCH EXCLAIMING
WE CAME ON AS SOON AS WE COULD
HE MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE
DID HE EVER VISIT HERE WHEN HE WAS A KID
YOU LUCKY KIDS HE SAID
THIS IS MY HEN LEDGER HE INFORMED HIM IN AN ABSORBED WAY
HAVE YOU GOT OUR KEYS HANDY
NEXT THE HEN WAS NESTED AND ALL SEEMED WELL
HER LEGS HUNG DOWN LONG AND THIN AS SHE SAT ON THE HIGH STOOL
FUSS FUSS OLD MAN
SAID YOU WORE YOURSELF OUT CLEANING ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS
SHE SOUNDED AS THOUGH THEY ALREADY EXISTED
WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT
THIS COAT LOOKS LIKE A RAG HEAP
IN A WEEK THE HYACINTHS WOULD SPIKE OUT
WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO TELL ME A CLOTHESHORSE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
LOVIE YOU MAKE ME FEEL NAKED
HOW DID ONE JOIN THEM
WERE YOU IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL
YOU'VE NOT SEEMED LIKE THEM BUT MAYBE YOU ARE
NURSES' TRAINING HERE DOESN'T COST ANYTHING
THEY EVEN PAY ME SIX DOLLARS A MONTH
SUCH OPTIMISM WAS COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED
YOUR LEG MUSCLES AND BACK MUSCLES FEEL WEARY
IF IT EVER GOT BEHIND ME THE BEEP TURNED TO A BUZZ
IT WAS A FAIRLY MODERN MOTEL WITH QUITE A BIT OF ELECTRICAL DISPLAY IN FRONT
IT'S A FORMALITY YOU KNOW
YOU SEE SHE'S ON A DIET
SHE LOOKED AT ME PROVOCATIVELY
KINDA LIKE A ZOMBIE
HE SPOKE SOOTHINGLY
YOU DON'T HAFTA GET NASTY
SO HE UNDERSTOOD HER PANIC
SHE BLEW HER NOSE ON A TISSUE AND OPENED THE COKE BOTTLE
OR BORROW SOME MONEY FROM SOMEONE AND GO HOME BY BUS
WHERE WERE THEY NOW
SOMEWHERE BIRDS WERE SWEETLY CALLING WERE ANSWERED
THE CAR DOOR CRASHED SHUT
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE GONE
DID ANYONE SEE MY CAB
HE THOUGHT HE SAW A PALE FACE AT A WINDOW
THERE WERE OTHER FARMHOUSES NEARBY
A FOOLISH THOUGHT CAME INTO HIS HEAD
HE REMEMBERED A STORY HE HAD READ AS A YOUTH
HE HELD HIS ARMS CLOSE TO HIS SIDES AND MADE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE
OH NO NOT AGAIN HE SAID ALOUD
BE EXCITED AND DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF
GOT NO BUSINESS OVER HERE ON A STAKE-OUT ANYWAY
THE KNIFELIKE PAIN IN HIS GROIN NEARLY BROUGHT HIM DOWN AGAIN
IT MOVED IN A SILVER ARC TOWARD HIS THROAT THEN VEERED DOWNWARD
ONE THING HE THOUGHT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT YET
HE PUT IT IN HIS OWN POCKET FOR SAFEKEEPING
THE BODY WAS HEAVIER THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED
IT SNOWED CONTINUOUSLY BUT QUIETLY EVENLY
THE SOFT SNOW WAS DECEITFUL UNDERFOOT
TWICE HE NEARLY FELL
DEEP ENOUGH HE DECIDED
HE CHECKED INTO A MOTEL AND DROVE DOWNTOWN
THE SHERIFF'S SWIVEL CHAIR TILTED BACK
SHE'D ALSO REMEMBER IF THE GROOM DIED LATER
HAVE THEY INHERITED SOME MONEY OR SOMETHING
SHE ASKED WITH A REPORTORIAL GLEAM IN HER EYE
COME ON LET'S HURRY DOWN BEFORE THEY LOCK UP FOR THE DAY
IT LATCHES WHEN YOU CLOSE IT SO STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
NOW DON'T SHUT THIS DOOR
SOMETHING ELSE DISTRACTED HIM YET THERE WAS NO SOUND ONLY TOMBLIKE SILENCE
THEN HE HEARD THE OUTER DOOR CLOSING
HEY COME BACK HE SHOUTED
NO THEY COULD KILL HIM JUST AS EASY RIGHT NOW
EXCEPT FOR THOSE MINUTES IN HER ROOM HE HAD LOST TOUCH WITH HER AS A REALITY
IT WAS AWKWARD VERY AWKWARD
SOMEONE REASONABLY TRUSTWORTHY
ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN ACE O' SPADES BAD LUCK
NOT WHEN SHE'D WAITED SO LONG ALREADY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO IDENTIFY AS OPIUM BY ITS ODOR
SO SOMEBODY ELSE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER FATHER'S MONEY IF SHE DIED
WELL THEN WHO BROUGHT IT
TAKE YOUR COBBLER'S SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE
EMOTIONALLY THEY PENETRATED HIM NOT AT ALL
AND SO HE WALKED AIMLESS AGAIN
WHEN HE LEFT SHE KNEW SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
YOU'RE A TAXPAYER HOUSEHOLDER LANDLORD
GOT THE UPSTAIRS GUY HE BELLOWS
THEY'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S COOKING
FOR A MAN OF HIS MASS HE WAS CURIOUSLY SHORT
ME HE SAID MERRILY
THOSE LOVELY WHORLS HE CHORTLED
THEY HAD COME NOT TO ADMIRE BUT TO OBSERVE
THEY'RE GOING TO LOUSE ME UP GOOD
YOU THINK SOMEBODY IS GOING TO STAND UP IN THE AUDIENCE AND MAKE GUILTY FACES
HE MAY TRY TO PHONE US
HERE'S WHERE LUCK WOULD NORMALLY STEP IN
WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK WHAT FOLLOWED WAS STRAINED EVEN MACABRE
HE DREW A DEEP BREATH
LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT HIS VOICE SHOOK
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY THINK OF ME
WE'VE DONE OUR PART
THEY TOOK IT AWAY OVERALLS OR SOMETHING
COME HOME RIGHT AWAY
HE DROVE AND THE ROAD WOBBLED FAMILIAR SCENES CREPT PAST ON EITHER SIDE
A NEW IDEA DRIFTED IN FROM NOWHERE
THEY WERE ALL FADED
WORN THROUGH AT THE KNEES
AND MEN ALSO USED VACUUM CLEANERS IN BOTH ROOMS SUCKING DUST UP ONCE MORE
CHECK THE OVERNIGHTERS OUT
ANYBODY CARRYING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HIDE A RIFLE
SHRUGS MET THAT FROM ROOM CLERKS FROM BELLHOPS
NOBODY IN HIS RIGHT MIND PUNISHES A QUARTER-CENTURY-OLD DERELICTION
JEOPARDIZE IT NOW TO CORRECT SO OLD A WRONG
BITTER UNREASONING JEALOUSY
HE ALSO REMINDED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES
IT WAS NOT WHATEVER TALE WAS TOLD BY TAILS
AND POSSESSED HIMSELF  HOW
THE POOR UNLUCKY  THE TELEPHONE RANG
BRAIN EXAMINED FOR THROMBOSIS CLOT OR HEMORRHAGE
NO SIGNS OF THESE NO GROSS HEMORRHAGE OF LUNGS HEART BRAIN OR STOMACH
OH THE TIME OF DEATH
PROBABLY AROUND MIDNIGHT GIVE OR TAKE AN HOUR EITHER WAY
SHE ALWAYS DID BEFORE AND SHOWED THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN WHATEVER WE ADVISED
WITH HER SHARP TONGUE SHE'D HAVE CUT HIS POMPOUSNESS TO RIBBONS
HE WENT ON TO PERSONAL BEQUESTS A LIST OF NAMES LARGELY UNKNOWN TO HIM
OLD PEOPLE HAVE THEIR IDIOSYNCRASIES
THIS ONE CAME A BIT HIGH AT THIRTY THOUSAND OR MORE
HIS SALARY HAD REACHED THE TEN THOUSAND MARK
HE WOULD OFFER NO THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR HER MURDER
IT'S STILL UNBELIEVABLE THAT IT WAS MURDER
NEVERTHELESS IT'S TRUE
COULD THE AMBASSADOR HIMSELF BE THE MAN ON THIS SIDE THE PRIME MINISTER FEARED
ONE MORE MUDDLEHEADED PLAY LIKE THAT ONE AND THEY'D BE LEADING HIM AWAY
IN THE LIGHTED INTERIOR HE SAW OTHER MEN AND WOMEN STRUGGLING INTO THEIR WRAPS
HE COULD PICK UP ANOTHER PACK ON HIS WAY HOME IF HE WERE GOING HOME
HE SAID THE CRAZY FOOL HALF ALOUD
ONLY THEN DID HE DECIDE HE DIDN'T WANT ONE
MEANWHILE FISHERMEN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM TO PULL UP WHOPPERS
HIS SARCASM WAS FOLLOWED BY A STUPID GRIN OF HIS THICK MOUTH AND BAD TEETH
WIDOW NICE SORT OF WOMAN
GOT A HECK OF A BUY ON THIS DIRT CHEAP
THE WRINKLED MOUTH LAUGHED REVEALING ASTONISHINGLY STRONG WHITE TEETH
HIDING OUT LIKE THIS WON'T GET HIM ANYTHING EXCEPT MORE TROUBLE OR A BULLET
IF SHE MOVED GRACEFULLY SHE WAS CLUMSY AT IT
THAT'S YOUR HEADACHE
SOAK UP LOCAL COLOR
NO OTHER VISITOR INQUIRED FOR HER THAT EVENING
WE HAVE BETTER ROOMS VACANT NOW HE BABBLED
TWO WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN CHATTERING LIKE PARROTS WERE STRUCK DUMB
THE CLERK'S EYES FLICKERED
SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME THE REAL REASON HE DRAWLED
THERE IS NO STORY HE PIPED TREMULOUSLY
A THICK CRIMSON CARPET MUFFLED EVERY FOOTFALL
HASTILY THE BOY SWITCHED ON A CEILING LIGHT
THE ROOM LOOKED NORMAL AND EVEN COMMONPLACE
THERE WAS NO HINT OF A VIOLENT STRUGGLE NOW
THE BLUE RUG WAS SUSPICIOUSLY BRIGHT AND NEW
AFRAID YOU'LL LOSE YOUR JOB IF YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
WERE YOU ON DUTY HERE TWO WEEKS AGO
WOMEN DIDN'T USE WHITE FACE POWDER NOWADAYS HE RECALLED
THEY USED PINK TAN OR CREAM POWDER
A MONSTROUS SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE ILLUMINATED WALL DISTORTED AND INDEFINABLE
THE SHADOW VANISHED
THERE WAS A THICK SQUASHY CRACK OF FIST ON FLESH
ROUGH CLOTH RASPED HIS FIST
THERE WAS A GRUNT CURIOUSLY INARTICULATE LIKE THAT OF AN ANIMAL IN PAIN
ON THE BARE FLOORBOARDS A MAN LAY FACE DOWN
THE MAN'S EYELIDS FLUTTERED
IT'S PERHAPS A MILE FROM HERE WHERE WE SIT
PRETTY GIRLS AMONG THEM WITH BLONDE HAIR AND PERT FACES
LIKE HIS GLOSSY BLACK HAIR
OH YES HE'D TALKED ABOUT DOING SO
NO THE MAN WAS NOT DRUNK HE WONDERED HOW HE GOT TIED UP WITH THIS STRANGER
WHY DON'T THEY TELL ME THEMSELVES IF IT BOTHERS THEM
THIS FAVORITE GRIEVANCE WAS NOT THE LANDLORD
BUT WHY PAY HER BILLS
HE SHRUGGED CASUALLY
HIS EYES BURNED FEVERISHLY
C'MON HE WHISPERED FLOOR LEVEL'S ABOUT THREE FEET DOWN SO DON'T FALL
WE'LL BOTH BE BLOWING TOWN TOMORROW SO WE WON'T BE MOVING IN ON YOU
HIS SURE-SURE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC THIS TIME
TO KAYO HIM AND MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT KILL
IF WE LEFT ONE WE'D HAVE TO WIPE IT FOR FINGERPRINTS
OUR HYPOTHETICAL OTHER BUM WHO KILLED HIM WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT HIS POCKETS
IN FACT NOBODY SAW US COP OR CITIZEN
IT HAD GONE LIKE CLOCKWORK
HOW SAFE IS TOO SAFE
SHALL WE FLIP A COIN TO SEE WHICH OF US GOES FIRST
SELF'S INTEGRITY WAS AND IS AND EVER HAD BEEN
THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS LOADED A TRAY LAVISHLY
OKAY TAKE THE TRAY
THAT'LL BE PLENTY TO EAT BY
PRESENTLY HIS WATER BROTHER SAID BREATHLESSLY
ETERNITY IS NO TIME FOR RECRIMINATIONS
YOU TOO WERE A STUPID JACKASS UNTIL YOU POISONED ME
AFTERWARDS YOU DID WELL ENOUGH
MIKE WAS OF LEGAL AGE AND PRESUMED ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN THE CLINCHES
ANYHOW IT WAS HIGH TIME THE BOY WAS SALTED
MY BELOVED WARD MY PERENNIAL GADFLY SAID THE WHINING VOICE
FUMING HELPLESS HE WATCHED THEM PASS HIM
HE RUBBED HIS EYES SLEEPILY WITH ONE HUGE PAW
A RANGE OF BLUFFS HUGGED THE HORIZON THE COLOR OF DECAYING MOSS
THESE PLANETS WERE MUCH BIGGER NEARLY ALL CAPABLE OF HOLDING AN ATMOSPHERE
BUT TO THE INFURIATION OF SCIENTISTS FOR NO KNOWN REASON NOT ALL OF THEM DID
SONIC ELECTRONIC GALVANIC  ALL BLANK
POSITIVE RESULTS START WHEN IT GOES TOWARDS THE HAND YOU USE TO MAKE YOUR MARK
HE WASN'T LIKELY TO COME DOWN WITH HOT CHILLS AND PUZZLING STRIPED FEVER
IT LOOKS LIKE WE DID WHEN WE MADE BLASTDOWN
MAYBE IT WOULD WORK THE OTHER WAY
ACTUALLY THEY SAID HE DID SLEEP BUT SO SHORTLY AND FITFULLY THAT HE FORGOT
HIS BODY PROCESSES ONLY SLOWED DOWN ENOUGH FOR HIM TO DISPEL FATIGUE POISONS
THE BUDDIES INVARIABLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIM
BEHIND HIM HIS MATES STIRRED WITHOUT WAKING
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW BUDDY
WHY PICK ME FOR YOUR PATSY
WHY ACCUSE A SHIPMATE OF BEING BEHIND THIS
THE TAPES SHOW THAT
THERE'S STILL SUCH A THING AS MENTAL ILLNESS
HER HUM BECAME A GURGLE OF SURPRISE
THE LADY'S EYES UNMAGNIFIED BUGGED OUT
YOU PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ADJUSTABLE VISION
THE GOOD MAN CHORTLED APPRECIATIVELY AND DECIDED THE TRIP WAS WORTH HIS TIME
SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO SING ANY ROLE AND ANY SONG WHICH STRUCK HER FANCY
WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE WAS THE SHIP
SHE WAS READY FOR HER GREAT ADVENTURES AND THE ARRIVAL OF HER MOBILE PARTNER
HELLO ANYONE AT HOME
THE SUDDEN SOLITUDE HAD LOST ITS MOMENTARY CHARM AND BECOME OPPRESSIVE
THE MANY-BODIED GIRL LAY NEAR HIM
SHE RADIATED WARMTH AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP
WE CAN DIE TOO WE CAN DIE LIKE REAL PEOPLE
HE REMEMBERED THEM WELL FROM HIS HAPPY PERIOD
A GOOD MORROW TO YOU MY BOY
YOU MEAN A GAME WITH CARDS
SOON SAID THE HALF-MAN
THUS EVENTS OCCURRED AND VICTIMS CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND NEW ONES ARRIVED
HE REMEMBERED THE LAST TIME HE HAD EATEN  ACTUAL EGGS FROM AN ACTUAL PAN
PEOPLE NEVER LIVE FOREVER
HER EYES WERE GLAZED AS IF SHE DIDN'T HEAR OR EVEN SEE HIM
NO GIRL WOULD GO THIS FAR TO FOOL A MAN SO SHE COULD KILL HIM
SHE DRANK GREEDILY AND MURMURED THANK YOU AS HE LOWERED HER HEAD
WE'LL WORK FOR OUR KEEP THE BOY SAID EAGERLY
WE'RE NOT DRUNKARDS SHE SAID
MY DRESS NEEDS SOME WORK ON IT
WE'LL PAY YOU BACK IF YOU'LL LET US
WE HAVEN'T SLEPT TOGETHER SINCE WE STARTED
YOU DON'T HATE ME ANY MORE
NOW THERE'S NOTHIN LEFT OF ME
THIRTY-FIVE THEY RODE AT A MEASURED PACE THROUGH THE VALLEY
THEN AT LAST THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO DISSOLVE
THEY NEITHER GAINED NOR FELL BACK
HE RODE LOW ON THE MARE'S NECK
A BAYONET HUNG IN A BELT SCABBARD
THE GUERRILLA BIVOUAC REMAINED SILENT
HE KISSED HER ALSO AND WITH DEEP TENDERNESS
RUNNING AROUND IN THE MOONLIGHT ALMOST NAKED AND SLUGGING A MAN WITH A ROCK
HE MIGHT SAY OR DO SOMETHING FOOLISH
THEY WERE TETHERED ARMY STYLE ON STABLE LINES
A VOICE SPOKE NEAR-AT-HAND
THERE'S NO CHANCE NOW OF ALL OF US GETTING AWAY
YOU'LL HAVE TO TRY IT ALONE
THAT TOUCHED OFF A TOTAL STAMPEDE
HE PICKED UP THE POWDER CANISTER AND RAN OUT
POWDER FLAME GUSHED BENEATH THE WAGON
GUERRILLAS WERE RACING TOWARD HIM
SOME TORE ENTIRELY THROUGH THE WHIPSAWED POST OAK
THE WAGONS WERE BURNING FIERCELY
THE MUDWAGON HAD CAUGHT FIRE ALSO
THE ROOF OF THE COMMAND POST BEGAN TO BUCKLE
ANYTHING WRONG CAP'N
THERE'S NO WAR ON NOW
HIS LEGS PUMPED FURIOUSLY HIS LONG BLACK HAIR STREAMED OUT BEHIND HIM
ALTHOUGH MY SHOT KILLED HIS HORSE HE ROLLED OFF THE BALE ON TOP OF ME
HIS EYES WERE DARK FLUID FEARFUL AND HE GAVE A SIGH AS MY KNIFE WENT IN
YOU COULD BURN DOWN THIS WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WITH A FIRE THAT SIZE
IT TOOK HIM A LONG TIME TO COMPOSE HIMSELF
MY FATHER RAN HIM OFF HERE SIX YEARS AGO
IT MIGHT HURT YOU THOUGH
AND HE WAS HANDSOME DESPITE THE LONG THIN SCAR THAT SLANTED ACROSS HIS CHEEK
SHE SEEMED IRRITATED
YOU'VE GOT NO BUSINESS UP HERE
YOU TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
THERE WOULD STILL BE PLENTY OF MOMENTS OF REGRET AND SADNESS AND GUILTY RELIEF
A WARM BREEZE PLAYED ACROSS IT MOVING IT LIKE WAVES
THE PULSING GLOW OF A CIGARETTE
WHEN HE SAW ME COMING HE TURNED HIS RADIO OFF
WHEN SUITABLY LIGHTED WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE
MEANWHILE SPRING HAD PASSED WELL INTO SUMMER
THEY HAD CHOSEN THIS NIGHT PURPOSELY
BURY THOSE UNIFORMS SO THEY WON'T BE FOUND
AFTER ANOTHER LONG PAUSE HE ASKED HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE
FAT SHOWED IN LOOSE ROLLS BENEATH THE SHIRT
HE LIVED AND BREATHED FOR THE MINING COMPANY
TEN YEARS AGO THEY BLEW UP SOME OF OUR DITCHES
IT COST US A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY DAYS LOST TIME TO FIX THEM
THE GUNMAN NODDED SLIPPING THE PICTURE INTO HIS BREAST POCKET SAYING NOTHING
AS SHE DROVE SHE THOUGHT ABOUT HER PLAN
IT WAS THERE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO ENACT HER RENUNCIATION BEG FORGIVENESS
PERHAPS IT WAS ALL A VIVIDLY CONCEIVED DREAM
NEVERTHELESS SHE CONTINUED TO MOVE UPWARD
IT CIRCLED HER THIGHS EXPLORING WITH ITS ICY TENTACLES
EVERY MOVEMENT SHE MADE SEEMED UNNECESSARILY NOISY
LIPS PURSED MOURNFULLY HE STARED DOWN AT ITS CRAZILY SAGGING LEFT SIDE
AND HIS RELATIVELY SMALL HANDS AND FEET GAVE HIM AN ALMOST DELICATE APPEARANCE
OR MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE A CIGAR
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT RATTLESNAKE GAG
GETTING THE BOSS RATTLESNAKE TO HELP YOU
SO WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT
WHY SINGLE ME OUT ON THIS PERMIT DEAL
YOU DO THAT OR TAKE YOU OUT A PERMIT RIGHT NOW
NOT IMMEDIATELY AS THE DEPUTY DEMANDED
OIL-FIELD WORKERS WERE A ROUGH-TOUGH LOT
A RABBIT PUNCH REDOUBLED HIM
NO MORE COULD HE DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THEM
WHY HE'S GOING TO KILL ME HE THOUGHT WILDLY
BEAT ME TO DEATH IN FRONT OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE
WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
IN MY PLACE YOU'D FOLLOW SUCH ADVICE AS YOU GIVE ME
WE'LL RIDE OUT AS SOON AS WE'VE HAD CHUCK
THEY WERE ALL GOOD MEN
LIGHTED WINDOWS GLOWED JEWEL-BRIGHT THROUGH THE DOWNPOUR
PUT ON HIS OLD BROWN CORDUROY COAT AND IT WAS ALREADY SOAKED
HE WAS ONLY VAGUELY AWARE OF THE SLUICING RAIN
WE'LL TALK OVER AT YOUR OFFICE
IT WAS SECURED BY AN OVERSIZED PADLOCK
FOR THE UNSEEN GHOSTLIKE RIFLEMAN AIMED A LITTLE HIGHER THE THIRD TIME
THE FORMER SCOUT'S ALIBI COULDN'T BE SHAKEN
PRIVATELY HE CREATED AND MAGNIFIED AN IMAGE OF HIMSELF AS A HIRED ASSASSIN
THE RUSTLING PROBLEM WAS BY NO MEANS SOLVED
THERE WERE NO TRACKS OF EITHER HOOFS OR BOOTS
HE MOISTENED HIS LIPS UNEASILY
WHO TOLD YOU TO DO IT
DOES THIS MAKE IT ANY EASIER COWARD
HE WANTED TO SHOW THE TOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO ANYONE WHO TRIED TO START TROUBLE
WE'RE GOING SOMEPLACE
WHERE'RE YOU TAKIN' ME
HONEY HE WHISPERED
LIKE ENOUGH WE'LL ALL BE UP ON TOP BY SUNDOWN
A SINGLE KICK MADE IT SPRING OPEN SHUDDERING
CLAPPING SPURS TO THE BRONC HE SET OFF AT A SHARP CANTER WITH GROWING ALARM
HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE RANCH HOUSE ACROSS THE BRUSHY SWELLS TOLD HIM NOTHING
HE HAD NOT COVERED A HUNDRED YARDS BEFORE A GUN CRASHED FROM SOMEWHERE BEHIND
A SLUG HAD TORN HALF OF HIS STIRRUP-GUARD AWAY
A SECOND TWITCHED HIS SHIRTSLEEVE AND HE FELT A BRIEF BURN ON HIS UPPER ARM
ANOTHER SNARLED CLOSE OVERHEAD
EACH PLANE CARRIED TWO FIVE-HUNDRED POUND BOMBS
THE PILOTS' HEADS LOOKED RIDICULOUSLY SMALL
IF THE OTHER PILOTS WERE WORRIED THEY DID NOT SHOW IT
ALTHOUGH THEY DREW LIGHT GROUND FIRE THEY SAW NO SIGNS OF ACTIVITY
TWELVE O'CLOCK LEVEL
THE OPPOSING AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO COME ON
IF ANY OF US MISS THEY CAN PICK UP THE PIECES
THE CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE ENEMY CONTINUED ON AS IF NO ONE ELSE WERE AROUND
LET'S TAKE 'EM HOME
PERFECT HE THOUGHT
THE ENEMY DID NOT VEER
AS IF DRAWN BY A WIRE THE ENEMY FLEW INTO THEM
A LARGE PIECE OF ENGINE COWLING VANISHED
WINGMAN STAY CLEAR HE PRAYED
HE FOUGHT THE PANIC OF VERTIGO
SOMETHING PULLED MY LEG
WE WERE OFF THE ROAD GLEAMING BARBED WIRE PULLING TAUT
HIGH SO IT WOULD ONLY BOUNCE HARMLESSLY BUT LOUDLY OFF THE CAR'S STEEL ROOF
ON UNOCCUPIED ROADWAY THE BOTTLE SHATTERED INTO A SMALL AMBER FLASH
TWO CARS CAME OVER A CREST THEIR CHROME AND GLASS FLASHING
BRAKES SHRIEKED BEHIND US
AND WHAT EYES THEY WERE
EYES LIKE HOT HONEY EYES THAT SIZZLED
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ANYWAY
ANYWAY IT WAS EVIDENT WHAT HE HAD IN MIND
HOW'S IT STRIKE YOU FOUL OR FAIR
ACCIDENT MURDER SUICIDE  TAKE YOUR PICK
HOW WILL WE WORK IT OUT
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ROAM THE STREETS IN COSTUMES AND MASKS AND HAVING A BALL
OR MORE RHYTHMICALLY THE SWARTHY WITCHES ARE LAUGHING
SHOULD SHE WAKE HIM
SO IF ALL THESE BEERS WAS TO GET ME IN BED MAN YOU JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
HE BLEW HIS NOSE EXPERTLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS
YOU SHALL SEE HER AT DINNER
LIKE AS IF IT WERE BUILT OF BOOKS
SHE TOOK IT GRUDGINGLY HER DARK EYES BALEFUL AS THEY MET HIS
SHE ASKED SMOLDERINGLY
WE CAN GET IT IF WE DIG HE SAID PATIENTLY
WE'RE LOST AND BURNING UP ALREADY SHE BIT OUT TENSELY
THEY'LL ROLL OFF IN ANOTHER DAY
IN A WAY HE COULDN'T BLAME HER
SHE HAD JUMPED AWAY FROM HIS SHY TOUCH LIKE A CAT CONFRONTED BY A SIDEWINDER
HE HAD LEFT HER INVIOLATE THINKING FAMILIARITY WOULD GENTLE HER IN TIME
HIS BLUE EYES SOUGHT THE SHIMMERING SEA OF HAZE AHEAD
TO HIS PUZZLEMENT THERE SUDDENLY WAS NO HAZE
HE SWUNG UP OVER THE WHEEL
THE CLOUDS BULGED DOWNWARD AND BURST SUDDENLY INTO A GREAT BLACK FUNNEL
THE CLOUDBURST CUT OFF ABRUPTLY
AT LEAST THE WHEELS DUG IN
HIS WIFE DIDN'T GIVE A SIGN SHE'D HEARD
THEY WERE ALREADY SWOLLEN TO BURSTING
SULPHUR OIL AND COPRA MAKE THE KIND OF TINDER ANY FIREBUG DREAMS OF
THE LIFEBOATS WERE STUCK FAST
HEAVE ON THOSE ROPES THE BOAT'S COME UNSTUCK
LET'S HOPE WE COME TO A SAFER PLACE
THEY WERE SHATTERED
LATER YOU SHALL KNOW IT BETTER
THE OLD WOMAN AROSE STIFFLY AND LED ME TO A CLEARING WHERE A SMALL HUT STOOD
THEN HE WOULD REALIZE THEY WERE REALLY THINGS THAT ONLY HE HIMSELF COULD THINK
WHAT OUTFIT DOES SHE DRIVE FOR
NOWADAYS WE TALK AS THOUGH THE BLITZ WERE JUST A SHORT SKIRMISH
THEY DON'T GO FOR BULL-LIKE MUSCLE AS A RULE
HE DIDN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH HE NOW FREELY ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
THE GREAT BLACK LEOPARDS
THEY CAME UPON CHEETAL DEER AT WOODLAND POOLS
HE TOOK HIS MASK FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND THREW IT UNEXPECTEDLY ACROSS THE DECK
A NOTE OF AWE CAME INTO HIS VOICE
OUR BOY DIDN'T CHICKEN OUT NO SIR
WHATEVER YOU TELL HIM HE WILL DIVE
HE TOOK A BIG SWIG OF HIS DRINK
IT WOULD BE A COLOSSAL SHAME TO THROW AWAY A STORY LIKE THIS
MAKE IT COME OFF ALL RIGHT
HE FELT A GOOD DEAL LESS SHAKY
AS HIS FEET SLOWED HE FELT ASHAMED OF THE PANIC AND RESOLVED TO MAKE A STAND
HE CROSSED THE NEXT MEADOW AND CLIMBED A TREE WHERE THE JUNGLE TRAIL RESUMED
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF WITH FIRMNESS NO SURRENDER
HIS SUPERIORS HAD ALSO PREACHED THIS SAYING IT WAS THE WAY FOR ETERNAL HONOR
HIS COMRADES WERE ALL DEAD
THE SHOT REVERBERATED IN DIMINISHING WHIPLASHES OF SOUND
YOU CAME WELL EQUIPPED TO DIE
ARE YOU A THROWER OF FLAME MARINE
WET ALSO WERE THE MARINE'S FATIGUES AND THE FACE HAD AN OILY FILM
BEFORE MUCH LONGER THE MARINE QUIETED DOWN
HE STRAIGHTENED UP ALERT NOW AS THE BUFFALO HUNTER CAME CLOSER
STAY RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU ARE KID HE CALLED
THE KID HAS NO MANNERS BOYS
SHALL WE TEACH HIM SOME
A THIRD SHOT DOUSED THE LIGHT
HE'LL SHOOT UP THE TOWN
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STREET COULD BE RAKED WITH RIFLE FIRE FROM THIS BARN
HE SIZED UP THE SITUATION AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE SLIPPED OUTSIDE HUGGING THE WALLS OF BUILDINGS AND DODGING INTO DOORWAYS
CAN'T SEEM TO LOCATE LANDMARKS IN THIS SNOW
ALL THAT TIME RIFLE BARRELS WERE POINTING UNWAVERINGLY AT HIS HEAD AND BODY
HE STROLLED BACK TO THE DOOR WHISTLING SOFTLY HANDS STILL CLASPED BEHIND HIM
WHY AIN'T YOU PLAYIN' BALL
THEY PLAYED CRACK THE WHIP A FEW MINUTES WITHOUT MISHAP
THANK YOU SHE SAID DUSTING HERSELF OFF
MAYBE SOME OTHER DAY
OH SHUCKS THE GIRL SAID
TO HIS SURPRISE HIS PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY
HE WAS GIFTED WITH ANIMAL MAGNETISM AND A POTENT ALLURE FOR WOMEN OF ANY RACE
LIFTING HER SKIRTS SHE CLIMBED IN NEVER RELINQUISHING HER GRIP ON HIS ARM
HE SAW A PINT-SIZED MAN WITH A GRAYING SPADE BEARD AND AN UNUSUALLY LARGE HEAD
YEAH SEEMS SO DON'T IT THE BOY LAUGHED HUGGING HER CLOSE
WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY
HIS HEAD CAME UP AND HE SAID IT DEFIANTLY
COME SIT HE REPEATED MOTIONING TO THE PILED HAY BAGS OVER THE PIG LEAVINGS
YEAH BUT WHAT'RE WE GONNA EAT
HE REACHED ONCE MORE INTO THE CARPET BAG AND BROUGHT UP A PACKAGE OF WIENERS
HE RIPPED DOWN THE CELLOPHANE CAREFULLY AND LAID THREE DOGS ON THE TIN FOIL
HOW COME YOU'RE RIDING THE RODS KIDS LIKE YOU
NOW FORGET ALL THIS OTHER
YOU GONNA GIVE ME A DRINK FELLA
MAYBE YOU AND ME WILL GIRLIE BUT THESE TWO AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE
OR THE BAY OF FEMALE DOGS IN HEAT
THEY HAD SLAPPED THEIR THIGHS
HE WOULD NOT CARRY A BRIEF CASE
ALL THE WHILE SHE SAT THERE HER SINEWY ARMS SWIRLED BEFORE HER CHEST
YOU'RE BOILING MILK AIN'T YOU
ABOVE HIM SLID THE EVASIVE SHADOW OF A STORM CLOUD
WHAT ABOUT A TEA ROOM THEN
SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL SO VALIANT SO PITIABLE
ABSOLUTION FOR HIS LIE
WHY LACERATE THE  CONGREGATION
HE'D HAD NO IDEA HOW UNHAPPY HIS SWEET PEACH HAD BEEN
IF HE EVER DID SUCH A THING AGAIN SHE'D DIE OF SHAME
HE SWUNG IN THROUGH HIS OWN WIDE GATEWAY
NO TEMPTATION NO VIRTUE
GO CHANGE YOUR SHOES BEFORE YOU TURN AROUND
HE THEN OFFERED HIS OWN ESTIMATE OF THE WEATHER WHICH WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC
HE SCOWLED AT HER FLOWERS
MY DAD DID IT AND HE LIVED TO A GREAT AGE
RAN AWAY ON A BLACK NIGHT WITH A LAWFUL WEDDED MAN
LEFT MINE MANY A TIME ONLY SHE NEVER KNEW IT
HE GAVE A SHORT HARD LAUGH AND LOOKED AT HER KNOWINGLY
BUT SHE SUFFERED IN HER OFF-DUTY HOURS
THEN AFTER A WHILE SHE WENT TO HER MIRROR
JUST WHY ANYBODY SHOULD WISH TO START A RIOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DIDN'T KNOW
HE MAY NOT RISE TO THE HEIGHTS BUT HE CAN GET BY AND EVENTUALLY BE RETIRED
SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR
AHAH HE THOUGHT A LUSH DIVORCEE AT LAST
IT GAVE HER A LEWD WINKING EFFECT
OUR KEY SALESMEN ARE IN APPLIANCES AND COSMETICS
IT SOUNDED SILLY WHY GO ON
DON'T FORGET WHISKEY IT'S SUCH A BIG SELLER
SHE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN AS IF HE HAD SOMEHOW DISAPPOINTED THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
WITH ANY LUCK AT ALL HE COULD EASILY FIND A FLOWERPOT
BUT ROULETTE'S NOT MY GAME
HE'S A PINTO AND HE PHOTOGRAPHS WONDERFULLY
HOW'S YOUR LUCK HONEY
STAKE ME SHE SAID AND LET ME AT THOSE DICE
NAMED AFTER THE BALLET
IS THERE ANY WORD YOU WOULD LIKE TO OFFER IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE
HE SAW THE DANGERS NOT THE GLORIES OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS A MUTINEER
THERE IS NOT SPACE TO HOLD OR FORCE TO GUARD ANY INCREASED NUMBER OF PRISONERS
THE INSTINCT OF DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN LOST
HE PAUSED THEN ADDED EVERYTHING ON A SHIP IS A WEAPON
ANOTHER FIELD HAD GIVEN HIM FAME ENOUGH TO SATISFY ANY EGOTIST
NOW THE HOPE WAS GONE
THIS TRAGIC LAD HAD FORGED HIS OWN SHACKLES
THE AIR SMELLED WARMISH AND FOUL
HIS BLACK HAT WITH ITS WIDE BRIM HIGH CROWN AND FUR TRIM RODE HIGH
ONE WHITE HAND POISED A STICK ABOVE HIS DESK
THE GUTTURAL LANGUAGE FROM THE GHETTO STOPPED
SOME OF THEM IGNORED THE TEXTS AND HAD APPARENTLY MEMORIZED THE WORDS LONG AGO
HIS BODY PITCHED BACK AND FORTH ON THE BENCH
DOES THIS BOTHER YOU
YOU HAD TO BE STUPID OR CRAZY OR IMMORTAL
SHE TOOK IT WITH HER WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE CHOSE IT
HERE THEY DID NOT NEED TO BE IN GHETTOS
ALL HIS FAMILY WAS DEAD EXCEPT FOR HIS SON
YOU FEEL HIM EVERY MILE FURTHER AWAY
EACH OF US HAD HIS OWN SPECIALTY BESIDES
THE EYE IS ALL INWARD OR OUTWARD
WHY SHOULD THIS SUDDENLY ASSAIL HER
THEN THE TELEPHONING BEGAN
WAS IT A HYSTERICAL RELEASE FROM THE LONG STRAIN OF VIGILANCE OF THOSE WEEKS
IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT
SHE OVERPLAYED HER HAND
WHY PUT SUCH A HIGH VALUE ON BEING TOP DOG
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO WORRY ME
WAS SHE JUST NATURALLY SLOPPY ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HER PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
BUT IT WAS A HOPEFUL SIGN HE TOLD HIMSELF
WHEN THEY GOT HOME AT MIDNIGHT SHE WAS TIRED OUT
LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE
LET'S BE FINE SUPERIOR PEOPLE OF GREAT DIGNITY HE SAID AS IF HE WERE JOKING
THEN HE FLED NOT WAITING TO SEE IF SHE MINDED HIM OR TOOK NOTICE OF HIS CRY
HE SANK BACK SIGHING AND WAS SOON ASLEEP AGAIN
HIS FINGERS FUMBLED ACROSS THE BANDAGES
HE RECOGNIZED HIS JACKET AND TROUSERS
SHE MUST HAVE PUT HIS CLOTHES IN THE CLOSET
HE WAS KNEELING TO TIE HIS SHOELACES
HIS FINGERS FELT ABSURDLY THICK AND CLUMSY
WHO WOULD TAKE OVER
FOR A MOMENT HE FELT LIKE A THIEF DISCOVERED
HER FACE SEEMED TO FLOAT IN AN IMPLAUSIBLY BRIGHT SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT
HE HAD NEVER FELT PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO HER
FORGET WE EVER KNEW WHAT
HIS VOICE SEEMED THICK AND PURPOSELESS
ARE YOU POSITIVE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT BY YOURSELF
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THEN
NO REALLY RIGHT AS RAIN
LOOK SWEETHEART SOME FOOL WAS
A SMILE PULLED AT THE LOWER STRIP OF ADHESIVE TAPE
THEY MAKE US CONFORMISTS LOOK GOOD
UPSTAIRS BUSY FEET SHOWERING LIKE RAINDROPS PATTERED AROUND HER ROOM
HIS DARK BROWS WHICH HAD BEEN LOWERED IN ANGER SMOOTHED
HOW LONG WOULD IT BE OCCUPIED
STRENGTH BEGAN TO ZIP UP AND DOWN HIS CHEST
HE WADDED HIS SWEAT SHIRT INTO A BALL AND STRIPPED DOWN TO HIS SWIMMING TRUNKS
AW SHUT UP HE SAID
SHIVERING HE PUT ON HIS CLOTHES
WATCH IT BIG SHOT A HOARSE VOICE YELLED BACK
SHE WAS HOLDING ON TO HIS ROCK WITH ONE HAND
HER COUGH SOUNDED LIKE CLOTH RIPPING
MY MOTHER NEVER WOPS ME
SHE SPOUTED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER INTO THE AIR
PART COLLIE PART WIRE-HAIRED TERRIER
NATURALLY CURLY HAIR RUNS IN MY FAMILY
BOOKS ARE FOR SCHNOOKS
EITHER THAT OR A VETERINARIAN
SHE SAID SHARKS HAVE NO BONES AND SHRIMP SWAM BACKWARD
HER FACE TURNED PINK WITH PLEASURE AND A SMOTHERED COUGH
HE DAYDREAMED ON THE ROCK WHILE SHE SWAM AND SPLASHED AROUND
HE SAYS HE'LL BE HERE ON THE ONE-O'CLOCK PLANE
YOU SAW THEM ALWAYS TOGETHER THOSE YEARS
NOW YOU KNOW SHE COULD'VE BUT SHE ISN'T THAT KIND OF GIRL
SHE DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REFUSE
BUT NOW SHE LOOKED UGLY
NOW MAYBE THEY'D REALIZE THAT LIFE CAN BE TOUGH
HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SOFT JOB AND NOW THE JOB WAS GONE AND HE WAS STRANDED
VIRUS INFECTION NOTHING SHE'D SCREAM AT HIM
A PROFESSION THAT BROUGHT ME AS GOOD AN INCOME AS MINE WASN'T TO BE SNEEZED AT
THE WARD WAS A SMALL ONE FOUR BEDS KEPT RESERVED FOR FEMALE ALCOHOLICS
BUT IF SHE WASN'T INTERESTED SHE'D JUST GO BACK TO THE SAME LIFE SHE'D LEFT
WILL YOU TELL ME WHY
SHE WENT ON DISREGARDING MY PROTESTS
JUST LET ME DIE IN PEACE
A LONG LONG WAY DOWN
THE REASONS FOR THIS DIVE SEEMED FOOLISH NOW
PRETTY SOON A WOMAN CAME ALONG CARRYING A FOLDED UMBRELLA AS A WALKING STICK
SHE SAW ME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME THREE FEET AWAY
NOT GOOD LOOKING BUT SELF-CONFIDENT AND WISE SO THAT IT MADE HER ATTRACTIVE
AS WE ATE WE TALKED
YES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RUN OFF TO USE THAT NEW TOOTHBRUSH
A BULLET SHE ANSWERED
NO RETURN ADDRESS WHATSOEVER
HE WAS FULL OF HEAVY FAMILY REMINISCENCE
THE RIDES WERE TAME ENOUGH  MOSTLY WE TALKED
SOMEBODY WITH NO VICES
AND NEVER SHOW MY FACE OR MY TRUCK AROUND HERE AGAIN
IT WAS AS BLISSFUL AND FULFILLING A NIGHT AS ANY BRIDE EVER EXPERIENCED
IT'S NEVER WRONG IF LOVE IS REAL
HE'D NOT ONLY TOLD ME SO HE'D PROVED IT
NO PRICE IS TOO HIGH WHEN TRUE LOVE IS AT STAKE
SHARE BATH MAYBE  BUT SHARE REFRIGERATOR
THE RED PILLS ARE A VITAMIN-AND-IRON COMPOUND
THIS IS A SLEEPING CAPSULE
YOU YOUNG MEN GET TO BE MY AGE YOU WON'T TAKE FLU SO LIGHTLY
IN THESE DAMP CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS AN ODDS-ON BET TO DEVELOP PNEUMONIA
FINE DAY AFTER TOMORROW SHE ADDED
RUN-DOWN IRON-POOR
BUT THEN REDHEADS ARE OFTEN PALE
YOU'RE HAVING A MISERABLE TIME AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSE WHAT'S-HIS-NAME GOT A SUNBURN
HOW'S YOUR SUNBURN NOW
WHEN HE FINALLY DID HE HAD TO DUCK HIS HEAD QUICKLY AWAY AS THE PITCH CAME IN
THEY WERE BOTH WALKING TOWARDS EACH OTHER UNHURRIED
FIGHTS SPRANG UP AND WERE QUICKLY SQUELCHED
WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU COME OUT WHEN YOU SAW THEM GANG UP ON ME
NOBODY ELSE DID EITHER
YOU DON'T BELONG IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL
NOW DON'T TELL ME WHAT A GOOD BALL PLAYER YOU ARE
BASEBALL'S NO CINCH
HIS LIPS FELT GLUED TOGETHER
THE LEAGUES ARE FULL OF GUYS LIKE THAT
WHY NOT TRY ANOTHER CLUB
HE NEEDS OUTFIELDERS BAD
TWENTY-TWO OR TWENTY-THREE
SNAKES ARE UGLY HE SAID AGAIN
NOBODY LIKES SNAKES
HE COULD TAKE THE ADVICE OR LEAVE IT
REAL BRIGHT ALONG THOSE LINES YOU MIGHT SAY
WEAKNESS IN LEADERSHIP
SHE ALWAYS COULD SENSE THE SHAG END OF A WOOLLY DAY
DID YOU KNOW HE IS ADVERTISING HIS HAM-RADIO EQUIPMENT FOR SALE THIS WEEKEND
ALL YOUR WISHFUL THINKING WON'T CHANGE THAT
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A MESSY AND NEGLIGENT MAN
HALF SLYLY HE ENJOYED SEEING HER STOOP TO LIFT THE THINGS
MORE HE COULD TAKE AT LEISURE
QUIETLY HE DETERMINED TO FOIL HER
HE SWUNG AROUND EYES TOWARD THE BEDROOM SOME FIFTEEN FEET AWAY
SUPPOSE HE RAN UP THE WHITE FLAG ALTOGETHER
BUT HIS RESOLUTION HARDLY SEEMED TO HELP
YOU WERE IN A HURRY WEREN'T YOU
THE TALE HE THOUGHT WOULD BECOME LESS GAY
HEAVY INDUSTRY SLANTED TOWARD INEXHAUSTIBLE GOVERNMENT COFFERS ATTRACTED HIM
WE'RE HERE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS
WE'VE ALL BEEN RICH AND SPOILED LONG ENOUGH TO HATE THE MACHINE AGE
NOBODY ELSE SHOWED PLEASURE
HELLO BOSS HE SAID AND GRINNED
THAT WORM A MURDERER
HIS MANHOOD HAD BEEN ATTACKED
JOKING STOPPED AND EVERYONE GATHERED AROUND
NEEDLESS TO SAY MY ART SUFFERED DRASTICALLY DURING THIS TURBULENT PERIOD
COULD IT DO OTHERWISE
DOGS DID SOMETHING TO ONE'S EGO
ADD THINGS AS YOU FIND YOU NEED 'EM
PERHAPS ONE BORED HOLES IN THE STONE WITH SOME KIND OF AN ELECTRIC GADGET
IT ALL SEEMED RATHER HOPELESS
NO HE DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY HANDYMAN-CARPENTER
IT ALL DID LOOK VERY EFFICIENT AND SHIPSHAPE
ONE SPECIES OF AMBIGUITY TRIES TO BAFFLE BY INTERWEAVING REPETITION
ANOTHER STOCK VAUDEVILLE GAG RAN MOTHER IS HOME SICK IN BED WITH THE DOCTOR
VIEW TAKES IN FIVE COUNTIES TWO BEDROOMS
OFFICIALS MEET ON RUBBISH
MANY SHAPES IN BATHTUBS
SAMPLES HE WALKED IN UPON HER INVITATION
NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON HAS THE ANATOMICAL BEEN CALLED JOCULAR JOURNALESE
IN NEWS ITEMS A MAN IS LESS OFTEN SHOT IN THE BODY OR HEAD THAN IN THE SUBURBS
A WOMAN MET A FAMOUS AUTHOR AT A LITERARY TEA
THE GIRL NODDED UNDERSTANDINGLY
YES SIR SHE SAID IS THAT DEFINITE
OF COURSE DEAR SHE SAID
ANOTHER BRAND OF INDEFINITE REFERENCE ARISES OUT OF THE USE OF THE DOUBLE VERB
FINALLY HE ASKED DO YOU OBJECT TO PETTING
AMBIGUITY ARISES WHEN THE PRONOUN IT CARRIES A TWOFOLD REFERENCE
THAT IS ONLY PARTLY NON-NONSENSE HE BEGAN
IS IT ANYTHING LIKE COOKED-OVER OATMEAL
THOSE WERE ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ALL OTHER GROWNUPS LAUGHED AT LOUDEST
JUST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FEEL IMPORTANT
THEIR CURIOSITY WENT HAPPILY OUT OF BOUNDS
YES MA'AM THE CHILDREN CHORUSED HEARTILY
ONE COULD HEAR A VERY FAINT LADYLIKE SIGH OF RELIEF
AS A RESULT HE WAS PERSUADED OUT TO DINNER
SOMETIMES HE COINCIDED WITH MY FATHER'S BEING AT HOME
MY MOTHER WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH CURIOSITY
VERY PECULIAR RETRIBUTION INDEED SEEMS TO OVERTAKE SUCH JOKERS
WHOSOEVER VIOLATES OUR ROOFTREE THE LEGEND STATES CAN EXPECT MAXIMAL SORROW
IN SHORT AND TO BORROW AN ARBOREAL PHRASE SLASH TIMBER
NOW HE'S BOUGHT IT SAID MY WIFE CONTENTEDLY
AS YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO DO THE SAME
YES MA'AM IT SURE WAS
I ALWAYS SAY YOU'VE GOT A WONDERFUL HUSBAND MISS MARGARET
MAY I GET SOME MORE COOKIES NORA
WELL WAIT UNTIL YOU FINISH WHAT YOU'VE GOT DAVY
AND NOW NORA  DON'T YOU ENCOURAGE HIM
WHY NORA THE VERY IDEA
NORA I THINK YOU IMAGINE IT
WELL JUNIOR DIDN'T HE EAT ONLY ONE AND MR HENRY DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT WELL
BUT EVERYBODY CALLS YOU JUNIOR
JUNIOR WHAT ON EARTH'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
DAVY MATHEWS IT'S DISGUSTING THE WAY YOU'RE ALWAYS EATING
WELL I GUESS I OUGHT TO DUST OUT THAT DESK ANYHOW
DON'T THEY STILL CALL YOU JUNIOR AS THOUGH YOU'RE ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD
MAYBE THEY'RE DELIVERING THE DESK NOW
THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR YOUR MOTHER'S DONATED MY FISHING TACKLE TO THE BAZAAR
SHE DIDN'T DONATE ANYTHING OF YOURS DID SHE
HE TOLD ME SO TODAY COMING UP ON THE TRAIN
WHEN WE LEFT WASHINGTON HIS SON TAD WAS ILL AND MRS LINCOLN HYSTERICAL
KEEP YOUR SEATS BOYS I JUST WANT TO PUT SOME FINISHING TOUCHES ON THIS THING
THEN MAY I ASK WHERE THESE MUDDY FOOT PRINTS CAME FROM
NOT VERY WELL BEHAVED IS SHE TO RUN OUT ON A PLAY MATE
I'M SORRY BUT I SHALL HAVE TO SEARCH THIS HOUSE
OH MOTHER I SAW THEM
AND NATHAN DID HE SEE THEM TOO
I'M GOING TO SEARCH THIS HOUSE
NOW IF YOU'LL PARDON ME I WON'T KEEP HIM WAITING
I SAW YOUR HORSE OUTSIDE
YOU'RE TO REPORT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS AT ONCE
BUT I'M SO SUNBURNED THAT EVERY MOVE I MAKE IS AGONY
MAY I GO AND GET CASSANDRA MOMMA
WELL THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO DO RIGHT NOW
ALICE I TELL YOU MY FEET ARE LIKE CHOPPED BEEFSTEAK
I'VE GOT TO BATHE MY FEET
GOSH THE HOUSE DOES LOOK LIKE A MORGUE THOUGH
YOU'D THINK HER STOMACH WOULD'VE GOT USED TO IT IN THREE WEEKS
YES YES WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
NOT WHEN I WAS A KID
