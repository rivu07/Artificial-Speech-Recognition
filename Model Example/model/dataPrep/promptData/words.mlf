"*/sample1631.lab"
HER

"*/sample1633.lab"
SAID

"*/sample1634.lab"
SHE
SOUNDED
AS

"*/sample1635.lab"
WE'VE
GOT
PLENTY
OF
TIME
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THAT

"*/sample1637.lab"
IN

THE

WERE

NURSES'

"*/sample1647.lab"
IF
IT

GOT
BEHIND

THE

TURNED
TO
A

.
"*/sample1648.lab"
IT
WAS
A
FAIRLY
MODERN
MOTEL
WITH
QUITE
A

OF
ELECTRICAL
DISPLAY
IN
FRONT
.
"*/sample1649.lab"
IT'S
A
FORMALITY
YOU
KNOW
.
"*/sample1650.lab"
YOU
SEE
SHE'S
ON
A
DIET
.
"*/sample1651.lab"
SHE
LOOKED
AT

PROVOCATIVELY
.
"*/sample1652.lab"
KINDA
LIKE
A

.
"*/sample1653.lab"
HE
SPOKE
SOOTHINGLY
.
"*/sample1654.lab"
YOU
DON'T
HAFTA
GET
NASTY
.
"*/sample1655.lab"
SO
HE
UNDERSTOOD
HER
PANIC
.
"*/sample1656.lab"
SHE
BLEW
HER
NOSE
ON
A
TISSUE
AND
OPENED
THE
COKE
BOTTLE
.
"*/sample1657.lab"
OR
BORROW
SOME

FROM

AND
GO
HOME
BY

"*/sample1658.lab"
WHERE
WERE
THEY
NOW
.
"*/sample1659.lab"
SOMEWHERE
BIRDS
WERE
SWEETLY
CALLING
WERE
ANSWERED
.
"*/sample1660.lab"
THE
CAR
DOOR
CRASHED
SHUT
.
"*/sample1661.lab"
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHERE
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
GONE
.
"*/sample1662.lab"
DID
ANYONE
SEE
MY

.
"*/sample1663.lab"
HE
THOUGHT
HE
SAW
A
PALE
FACE
AT
A
WINDOW
.
"*/sample1664.lab"
THERE
WERE
OTHER
FARMHOUSES
NEARBY
.
"*/sample1665.lab"
A
FOOLISH
THOUGHT
CAME
INTO
HIS
HEAD
.
"*/sample1666.lab"
HE
REMEMBERED
A
STORY
HE
HAD
READ
AS
A
YOUTH
.
"*/sample1667.lab"
HE
HELD
HIS
ARMS
CLOSE
TO
HIS
SIDES
AND
MADE
HIMSELF
AS
SMALL
AS
POSSIBLE
.
"*/sample1668.lab"
OH
NO
NOT
AGAIN
HE
SAID
ALOUD
.
"*/sample1669.lab"
BE
EXCITED
AND
DON'T
IDENTIFY
YOURSELF
.
"*/sample1670.lab"
GOT
NO
BUSINESS
OVER
HERE
ON
A
STAKE-OUT
ANYWAY
.
"*/sample1671.lab"
THE
KNIFELIKE
PAIN
IN
HIS
GROIN
NEARLY
BROUGHT
HIM
DOWN
AGAIN
.
"*/sample1672.lab"
IT
MOVED
IN
A
SILVER
ARC
TOWARD
HIS
THROAT
THEN
VEERED
DOWNWARD
.
"*/sample1673.lab"
ONE
THING
HE
THOUGHT
NOBODY
KNOWS
ABOUT
IT
YET
.
"*/sample1674.lab"
HE
PUT
IT
IN
HIS
OWN
POCKET
FOR
SAFEKEEPING
.
"*/sample1675.lab"
THE
BODY
WAS
HEAVIER
THAN
HE
HAD
ANTICIPATED
.
"*/sample1676.lab"
IT
SNOWED
CONTINUOUSLY
BUT
QUIETLY
EVENLY
.
"*/sample1677.lab"
THE
SOFT
SNOW
WAS
DECEITFUL
UNDERFOOT
.
"*/sample1678.lab"
TWICE
HE
NEARLY
FELL
.
"*/sample1679.lab"
DEEP
ENOUGH
HE
DECIDED
.
"*/sample1680.lab"
HE
CHECKED
INTO
A
MOTEL
AND
DROVE
DOWNTOWN
.
"*/sample1681.lab"
THE
SHERIFF'S
SWIVEL
CHAIR
TILTED
BACK
.
"*/sample1682.lab"
SHE'D
ALSO
REMEMBER
IF
THE
GROOM
DIED
LATER
.
"*/sample1683.lab"
HAVE
THEY
INHERITED
SOME
MONEY
OR
SOMETHING
.
"*/sample1684.lab"
SHE
ASKED
WITH
A
REPORTORIAL
GLEAM
IN
HER
EYE
.
"*/sample1685.lab"
COME
ON
LET'S
HURRY
DOWN
BEFORE
THEY
LOCK
UP
FOR
THE
DAY
.
"*/sample1686.lab"
IT
LATCHES
WHEN
YOU
CLOSE
IT
SO
STAY
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
LIKE
.
"*/sample1687.lab"
NOW
DON'T
SHUT
THIS
DOOR
.
"*/sample1688.lab"
SOMETHING
ELSE
DISTRACTED
HIM
YET
THERE
WAS
NO
SOUND
ONLY
TOMBLIKE
SILENCE
.
"*/sample1689.lab"
THEN
HE
HEARD
THE
OUTER
DOOR
CLOSING
.
"*/sample1690.lab"
HEY
COME
BACK
HE
SHOUTED
.
"*/sample1691.lab"
NO
THEY
COULD
KILL
HIM
JUST
AS
EASY
RIGHT
NOW
.
"*/sample1692.lab"
EXCEPT
FOR
THOSE
MINUTES
IN
HER
ROOM
HE
HAD
LOST
TOUCH
WITH
HER
AS
A
REALITY
.
"*/sample1693.lab"
IT
WAS
AWKWARD
VERY
AWKWARD
.
"*/sample1694.lab"
SOMEONE
REASONABLY
TRUSTWORTHY
.
"*/sample1695.lab"
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
AN
ACE
O'
SPADES
BAD
LUCK
.
"*/sample1696.lab"
NOT
WHEN
SHE'D
WAITED
SO
LONG
ALREADY
.
"*/sample1697.lab"
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EASY
TO
IDENTIFY
AS
OPIUM
BY
ITS
ODOR
.
"*/sample1698.lab"
SO
SOMEBODY
ELSE
KNEW
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
HER
FATHER'S
MONEY
IF
SHE
DIED
.
"*/sample1699.lab"
WELL
THEN
WHO
BROUGHT
IT
.
"*/sample1700.lab"
TAKE
YOUR
COBBLER'S
SHOP
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
.
"*/sample1701.lab"
EMOTIONALLY
THEY
PENETRATED
HIM
NOT
AT
ALL
.
"*/sample1702.lab"
AND
SO
HE
WALKED
AIMLESS
AGAIN
.
"*/sample1703.lab"
WHEN
HE
LEFT
SHE
KNEW
SHE
WOULD
NEVER
SEE
HIM
AGAIN
.
"*/sample1704.lab"
YOU'RE
A
TAXPAYER
HOUSEHOLDER
LANDLORD
.
"*/sample1705.lab"
GOT
THE
UPSTAIRS
GUY
HE
BELLOWS
.
"*/sample1706.lab"
THEY'LL
TELL
YOU
WHAT'S
COOKING
.
"*/sample1707.lab"
FOR
A
MAN
OF
HIS
MASS
HE
WAS
CURIOUSLY
SHORT
.
"*/sample1708.lab"
ME
HE
SAID
MERRILY
.
"*/sample1709.lab"
THOSE
LOVELY
WHORLS
HE
CHORTLED
.
"*/sample1710.lab"
THEY
HAD
COME
NOT
TO
ADMIRE
BUT
TO
OBSERVE
.
"*/sample1711.lab"
THEY'RE
GOING
TO
LOUSE
ME
UP
GOOD
.
"*/sample1712.lab"
YOU
THINK
SOMEBODY
IS
GOING
TO
STAND
UP
IN
THE
AUDIENCE
AND
MAKE
GUILTY
FACES
.
"*/sample1713.lab"
HE
MAY
TRY
TO
PHONE
US
.
"*/sample1714.lab"
HERE'S
WHERE
LUCK
WOULD
NORMALLY
STEP
IN
.
"*/sample1715.lab"
WITHIN
THIS
FRAMEWORK
WHAT
FOLLOWED
WAS
STRAINED
EVEN
MACABRE
.
"*/sample1716.lab"
HE
DREW
A
DEEP
BREATH
.
"*/sample1717.lab"
LULLABY
AND
GOODNIGHT
HIS
VOICE
SHOOK
.
"*/sample1718.lab"
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
THINK
OF
ME
.
"*/sample1719.lab"
WE'VE
DONE
OUR

"*/sample1720.lab"
THEY
TOOK
IT
AWAY
OVERALLS
OR
SOMETHING
.
"*/sample1721.lab"
COME
HOME
RIGHT
AWAY
.
"*/sample1722.lab"
HE
DROVE
AND
THE

WOBBLED
FAMILIAR
SCENES
CREPT
PAST
ON
EITHER
SIDE
.
"*/sample1723.lab"
A
NEW
IDEA
DRIFTED
IN
FROM
NOWHERE
.
"*/sample1724.lab"
THEY
WERE
ALL
FADED
.
"*/sample1725.lab"
WORN
THROUGH
AT
THE

.
"*/sample1726.lab"
AND

ALSO

"*/sample1727.lab"
CHECK

"*/sample1728.lab"
ANYBODY
CARRYING

HIDE
A

.
"*/sample1729.lab"
SHRUGS
MET
THAT
FROM

CLERKS
FROM

.
"*/sample1730.lab"
NOBODY
IN
HIS

PUNISHES
A
QUARTER-CENTURY-OLD
DERELICTION
.
"*/sample1731.lab"
JEOPARDIZE
IT
NOW
TO
CORRECT
SO
OLD
A
WRONG
.
"*/sample1732.lab"
BITTER
UNREASONING
JEALOUSY
.
"*/sample1733.lab"
HE
ALSO
REMINDED
HIMSELF
THAT
HE
HAD
AN
UNUSUAL
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBILITIES
.
"*/sample1734.lab"
IT
WAS
NOT
WHATEVER
TALE
WAS
TOLD
BY

.
"*/sample1735.lab"
AND
POSSESSED
HIMSELF
HOW

"*/sample1740.lab"
PROBABLY
AROUND
MIDNIGHT
GIVE

TAKE
AN

EITHER

.
"*/sample1741.lab"
SHE
ALWAYS
DID

AND
SHOWED
THE
UTMOST
CONFIDENCE
IN
WHATEVER
WE
ADVISED
.
"*/sample1742.lab"
WITH
HER
SHARP
TONGUE
SHE'D
HAVE
CUT
HIS
POMPOUSNESS
TO
RIBBONS
.
"*/sample1743.lab"
HE
WENT
ON
TO
PERSONAL
BEQUESTS
A

OF

LARGELY
UNKNOWN

"*/sample1744.lab"
OLD

THIS

"*/sample1746.lab"
HIS

HAD
REACHED
THE

"*/sample1747.lab"
HE
WOULD
OFFER
NO

TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
HER
MURDER
.
"*/sample1748.lab"
IT'S
STILL
UNBELIEVABLE
THAT
IT
WAS
MURDER
.
"*/sample1749.lab"
NEVERTHELESS
IT'S
TRUE
.
"*/sample1750.lab"
COULD
THE

"*/sample1752.lab"
IN
THE

HE
SAW
OTHER

STRUGGLING
INTO
THEIR

"*/sample1753.lab"
HE
COULD
PICK
UP
ANOTHER

WERE
GOING

.
"*/sample1754.lab"
HE
SAID
THE

DID
HE
DECIDE

DIDN'T

"*/sample1792.lab"
WHY
DON'T

"*/sample1793.lab"
THIS

"*/sample1795.lab"
HE
SHRUGGED

"*/sample1921.lab"
AND
HIS
RELATIVELY
SMALL

GAVE

AN
ALMOST

"*/sample2003.lab"
IN

COULDN'T
BLAME
HER

"*/sample2004.lab"
SHE
HAD
JUMPED
AWAY
FROM
HIS
SHY
TOUCH
LIKE
A
CAT
CONFRONTED
BY
A
SIDEWINDER
.
"*/sample2005.lab"
HE
HAD
LEFT
HER

THINKING
FAMILIARITY
WOULD
GENTLE
HER
IN

"*/sample2006.lab"
HIS
BLUE
EYES
SOUGHT
THE
SHIMMERING
SEA
OF
HAZE
AHEAD
.
"*/sample2007.lab"
TO
HIS
PUZZLEMENT
THERE
SUDDENLY
WAS
NO
HAZE
.
"*/sample2008.lab"
HE
SWUNG
UP
OVER
THE
WHEEL
.
"*/sample2009.lab"
THE
CLOUDS
BULGED
DOWNWARD
AND
BURST
SUDDENLY
INTO
A
GREAT
BLACK
FUNNEL

"*/sample2010.lab"
THE

CUT
OFF
ABRUPTLY

"*/sample2011.lab"
AT

HIS

THEY
WERE
SHATTERED

"*/sample2019.lab"
LATER
YOU
SHALL
KNOW
IT
BETTER

"*/sample2020.lab"
THE
OLD
WOMAN
AROSE
STIFFLY
AND
LED
ME
TO
A
CLEARING
WHERE
A
SMALL
HUT
STOOD
.
"*/sample2021.lab"
THEN
HE
WOULD
REALIZE
THEY
WERE
REALLY
THINGS
THAT
ONLY
HE
HIMSELF
COULD
THINK
.
"*/sample2022.lab"
WHAT
OUTFIT
DOES
SHE
DRIVE
FOR
.
"*/sample2023.lab"
NOWADAYS
WE
TALK
AS
THOUGH
THE
BLITZ
WERE
JUST
A
SHORT
SKIRMISH
.
"*/sample2024.lab"
THEY
DON'T
GO
FOR
BULL-LIKE
MUSCLE
AS
A
RULE
.
"*/sample2025.lab"
HE
DIDN'T
TELL
HER
THE
TRUTH
HE
NOW
FREELY
ADMITTED
TO
HIMSELF
.
"*/sample2026.lab"
THE
GREAT
BLACK
LEOPARDS
.
"*/sample2027.lab"
THEY
CAME
UPON
CHEETAL
DEER
AT
WOODLAND
POOLS
.
"*/sample2028.lab"
HE
TOOK
HIS
MASK
FROM
HIS
FOREHEAD
AND
THREW
IT
UNEXPECTEDLY
ACROSS
THE
DECK
.
"*/sample2029.lab"
A
NOTE
OF
AWE
CAME
INTO
HIS

.
"*/sample2030.lab"
OUR

DIDN'T
CHICKEN
OUT
NO
SIR
.
"*/sample2031.lab"
WHATEVER
YOU
TELL
HIM
HE
WILL
DIVE
.
"*/sample2032.lab"
HE
TOOK
A
BIG
SWIG
OF
HIS
DRINK
.
"*/sample2033.lab"
IT
WOULD
BE
A
COLOSSAL
SHAME
TO
THROW
AWAY
A
STORY
LIKE
THIS
.
"*/sample2034.lab"
MAKE
IT
COME
OFF
ALL
RIGHT
.
"*/sample2035.lab"
HE
FELT
A
GOOD
DEAL
LESS
SHAKY
.
"*/sample2036.lab"
AS
HIS
FEET
SLOWED
HE
FELT
ASHAMED
OF
THE
PANIC
AND
RESOLVED
TO
MAKE
A
STAND
.
"*/sample2037.lab"
HE
CROSSED
THE
NEXT
MEADOW
AND
CLIMBED
A
TREE
WHERE
THE
JUNGLE
TRAIL
RESUMED
.
"*/sample2038.lab"
HE
MURMURED
TO
HIMSELF
WITH
FIRMNESS
NO
SURRENDER
.
"*/sample2039.lab"
HIS
SUPERIORS
HAD
ALSO
PREACHED
THIS
SAYING
IT
WAS
THE
WAY
FOR
ETERNAL
HONOR
.
"*/sample2040.lab"
HIS
COMRADES
WERE
ALL
DEAD
.
"*/sample2041.lab"
THE
SHOT
REVERBERATED
IN
DIMINISHING
WHIPLASHES
OF
SOUND
.
"*/sample2042.lab"
YOU
CAME
WELL
EQUIPPED
TO
DIE
.
"*/sample2043.lab"
ARE
YOU
A
THROWER
OF
FLAME
MARINE
.
"*/sample2044.lab"
WET
ALSO
WERE
THE

HAD
AN

"*/sample2045.lab"
BEFORE
MUCH
LONGER
THE

QUIETED
DOWN
.
"*/sample2046.lab"
HE
STRAIGHTENED
UP
ALERT
NOW
AS
THE
BUFFALO
HUNTER
CAME
CLOSER
.
"*/sample2047.lab"
STAY
RIGHT
HERE
WHERE
YOU
ARE

HE
CALLED
.
"*/sample2048.lab"
THE
KID
HAS
NO

"*/sample2049.lab"
SHALL
WE
TEACH
HIM
SOME
.
"*/sample2050.lab"
A
THIRD
SHOT
DOUSED
THE
LIGHT
.
"*/sample2051.lab"
HE'LL
SHOOT
UP
THE
TOWN
.
"*/sample2052.lab"
THE
ENTIRE
LENGTH
OF
THE
STREET
COULD
BE
RAKED
WITH
RIFLE
FIRE
FROM
THIS
BARN
.
"*/sample2053.lab"
HE
SIZED
UP
THE
SITUATION
AND
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD
.
"*/sample2054.lab"
HE
SLIPPED
OUTSIDE
HUGGING
THE
WALLS
OF
BUILDINGS
AND
DODGING
INTO
DOORWAYS
.
"*/sample2055.lab"
CAN'T
SEEM
TO
LOCATE
LANDMARKS
IN
THIS
SNOW
.
"*/sample2056.lab"
ALL
THAT
TIME
RIFLE
BARRELS
WERE
POINTING
UNWAVERINGLY
AT
HIS
HEAD
AND
BODY
.
"*/sample2057.lab"
HE
STROLLED
BACK
TO
THE
DOOR
WHISTLING
SOFTLY
HANDS
STILL
CLASPED
BEHIND
HIM
.
"*/sample2058.lab"
WHY
AIN'T
YOU
PLAYIN'
BALL
.
"*/sample2059.lab"
THEY
PLAYED
CRACK
THE
WHIP
A
FEW
MINUTES
WITHOUT
MISHAP
.
"*/sample2060.lab"
THANK
YOU
SHE
SAID
DUSTING
HERSELF
OFF
.
"*/sample2061.lab"
MAYBE
SOME
OTHER

.
"*/sample2062.lab"
OH
SHUCKS
THE
GIRL
SAID
.
"*/sample2063.lab"
TO
HIS
SURPRISE
HIS
PLAN
WORKED
PERFECTLY
.
"*/sample2064.lab"
HE
WAS
GIFTED
WITH
ANIMAL
MAGNETISM
AND
A
POTENT
ALLURE
FOR
WOMEN
OF
ANY
RACE
.
"*/sample2065.lab"
LIFTING
HER
SKIRTS
SHE
CLIMBED
IN
NEVER
RELINQUISHING
HER
GRIP
ON
HIS
ARM
.
"*/sample2066.lab"
HE
SAW
A
PINT-SIZED
MAN
WITH
A
GRAYING
SPADE
BEARD
AND
AN
UNUSUALLY
LARGE
HEAD
.
"*/sample2067.lab"
YEAH
SEEMS
SO
DON'T

THE

LAUGHED
HUGGING
HER
CLOSE
.
"*/sample2068.lab"
WE
DON'T
KNOW
THIS
GUY
.
"*/sample2069.lab"
HIS
HEAD
CAME
UP
AND
HE
SAID
IT
DEFIANTLY
.
"*/sample2070.lab"
COME
SIT
HE
REPEATED
MOTIONING
TO
THE
PILED
HAY
BAGS
OVER
THE
PIG
LEAVINGS
.
"*/sample2071.lab"
YEAH
BUT
WHAT'RE
WE
GONNA
EAT
.
"*/sample2072.lab"
HE
REACHED
ONCE
MORE
INTO
THE
CARPET
BAG
AND
BROUGHT
UP
A
PACKAGE
OF
WIENERS
.
"*/sample2073.lab"
HE
RIPPED
DOWN
THE
CELLOPHANE
CAREFULLY
AND
LAID
THREE
DOGS
ON
THE
TIN
FOIL
.
"*/sample2074.lab"
HOW

"*/sample2078.lab"
OR

IN

.
"*/sample2079.lab"
THEY
HAD
SLAPPED
THEIR

.
"*/sample2080.lab"
HE
WOULD
NOT
CARRY
A
BRIEF
CASE
.
"*/sample2081.lab"
ALL
THE
WHILE
SHE
SAT
THERE
HER
SINEWY
ARMS
SWIRLED
BEFORE
HER
CHEST
.
"*/sample2082.lab"
YOU'RE
BOILING
MILK
AIN'T
YOU
.
"*/sample2083.lab"
ABOVE
HIM
SLID
THE
EVASIVE
SHADOW
OF
A
STORM
CLOUD
.
"*/sample2084.lab"
WHAT
ABOUT
A
TEA
ROOM
THEN
.
"*/sample2085.lab"
SHE
WAS
SO
BEAUTIFUL
SO
VALIANT
SO
PITIABLE
.
"*/sample2086.lab"
ABSOLUTION
FOR
HIS
LIE
.
"*/sample2087.lab"
WHY
LACERATE
THE
CONGREGATION
.
"*/sample2088.lab"
HE'D
HAD
NO
IDEA
HOW
UNHAPPY
HIS
SWEET
PEACH
HAD
BEEN
.
"*/sample2089.lab"
IF
HE
EVER
DID
SUCH
A
THING
AGAIN
SHE'D
DIE
OF
SHAME
.
"*/sample2090.lab"
HE
SWUNG
IN
THROUGH
HIS
OWN
WIDE
GATEWAY
.
"*/sample2091.lab"
NO
TEMPTATION
NO
VIRTUE
.
"*/sample2092.lab"
GO
CHANGE
YOUR
SHOES
BEFORE
YOU
TURN
AROUND
.
"*/sample2093.lab"
HE
THEN
OFFERED
HIS
OWN
ESTIMATE
OF
THE
WEATHER
WHICH
WAS
UNENTHUSIASTIC
.
"*/sample2094.lab"
HE
SCOWLED
AT
HER
FLOWERS
.
"*/sample2095.lab"
MY
DAD
DID
IT
AND
HE
LIVED
TO
A
GREAT
AGE
.
"*/sample2096.lab"
RAN
AWAY
ON
A
BLACK
NIGHT
WITH
A
LAWFUL
WEDDED
MAN
.
"*/sample2097.lab"
LEFT
MINE
MANY
A
TIME
ONLY
SHE
NEVER
KNEW
IT
.
"*/sample2098.lab"
HE
GAVE
A
SHORT
HARD
LAUGH
AND
LOOKED
AT
HER
KNOWINGLY
.
"*/sample2099.lab"
BUT
SHE
SUFFERED
IN
HER
OFF-DUTY
HOURS
.
"*/sample2100.lab"
THEN
AFTER
A
WHILE
SHE
WENT
TO
HER
MIRROR
.
"*/sample2101.lab"
JUST
WHY
ANYBODY
SHOULD
WISH
TO
START
A
RIOT
THE
EXECUTIVE
OFFICER
DIDN'T
KNOW
.
"*/sample2102.lab"
HE
MAY
NOT
RISE
TO
THE
HEIGHTS
BUT
HE
CAN
GET
BY
AND
EVENTUALLY
BE
RETIRED
.
"*/sample2103.lab"
SEE
YOU
IN
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
.
"*/sample2104.lab"
AHAH
HE
THOUGHT
A
LUSH
DIVORCEE
AT
LAST
.
"*/sample2105.lab"
IT
GAVE
HER
A
LEWD
WINKING
EFFECT
.
"*/sample2106.lab"
OUR
KEY
SALESMEN
ARE
IN
APPLIANCES
AND
COSMETICS
.
"*/sample2107.lab"
IT
SOUNDED
SILLY
WHY
GO
ON
.
"*/sample2108.lab"
DON'T
FORGET
WHISKEY
IT'S
SUCH
A
BIG
SELLER
.
"*/sample2109.lab"
SHE
LOOKED
CRESTFALLEN
AS
IF
HE
HAD
SOMEHOW
DISAPPOINTED
THE
WHOLE
HUMAN
RACE
.
"*/sample2110.lab"
WITH
ANY
LUCK
AT
ALL
HE
COULD
EASILY
FIND
A
FLOWERPOT
.
"*/sample2111.lab"
BUT
ROULETTE'S
NOT
MY

.
"*/sample2112.lab"
HE'S
A

PHOTOGRAPHS
WONDERFULLY
.
"*/sample2113.lab"
HOW'S
YOUR

"*/sample2114.lab"
STAKE
ME
SHE
SAID
AND
LET
ME
AT
THOSE

.
"*/sample2115.lab"
NAMED
AFTER
THE
BALLET
.
"*/sample2116.lab"
IS
THERE
ANY
WORD
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
OFFER
IN
YOUR
OWN
DEFENSE
.
"*/sample2117.lab"
HE
SAW
THE
DANGERS
NOT
THE
GLORIES
OF
BEING
IDENTIFIED
AS
A
MUTINEER
.
"*/sample2118.lab"
THERE
IS
NOT
SPACE
TO
HOLD
OR
FORCE
TO
GUARD
ANY
INCREASED
NUMBER
OF
PRISONERS
.
"*/sample2119.lab"
THE
INSTINCT
OF
DISCIPLINE
HAS
BEEN
LOST
.
"*/sample2120.lab"
HE
PAUSED
THEN
ADDED
EVERYTHING
ON
A
SHIP
IS
A
WEAPON
.
"*/sample2121.lab"
ANOTHER
FIELD
HAD
GIVEN
HIM
FAME
ENOUGH
TO
SATISFY
ANY
EGOTIST
.
"*/sample2122.lab"
NOW
THE
HOPE
WAS
GONE
.
"*/sample2123.lab"
THIS
TRAGIC
LAD
HAD
FORGED
HIS
OWN
SHACKLES
.
"*/sample2124.lab"
THE
AIR
SMELLED
WARMISH
AND
FOUL
.
"*/sample2125.lab"
HIS

WITH

.
"*/sample2126.lab"
ONE
WHITE

POISED
A

ABOVE
HIS

.
"*/sample2127.lab"
THE
GUTTURAL
LANGUAGE
FROM
THE
GHETTO
STOPPED
.
"*/sample2128.lab"
SOME
OF
THEM
IGNORED
THE
TEXTS
AND
HAD
APPARENTLY
MEMORIZED
THE
WORDS
LONG
AGO
.
"*/sample2129.lab"
HIS
BODY
PITCHED
BACK
AND
FORTH
ON
THE
BENCH
.
"*/sample2130.lab"
DOES
THIS
BOTHER
YOU
.
"*/sample2131.lab"
YOU
HAD
TO
BE
STUPID
OR
CRAZY
OR
IMMORTAL
.
"*/sample2132.lab"
SHE
TOOK
IT
WITH
HER
WHEREVER
SHE
WENT
SHE
CHOSE
IT
.
"*/sample2133.lab"
HERE
THEY
DID
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
IN
GHETTOS
.
"*/sample2134.lab"
ALL
HIS

WAS
DEAD
EXCEPT
FOR
HIS

.
"*/sample2135.lab"
YOU
FEEL
HIM
EVERY

FURTHER
AWAY
.
"*/sample2136.lab"
EACH

HAD
HIS

BESIDES
.
"*/sample2137.lab"
THE

IS
ALL
INWARD
OR
OUTWARD
.
"*/sample2138.lab"
WHY
SHOULD
THIS
SUDDENLY
ASSAIL
HER
.
"*/sample2139.lab"
THEN
THE
TELEPHONING
BEGAN
.
"*/sample2140.lab"
WAS
IT
A
HYSTERICAL
RELEASE
FROM
THE
LONG
STRAIN
OF
VIGILANCE
OF
THOSE
WEEKS
.
"*/sample2141.lab"
IT
WAS
NOBODY'S
FAULT
.
"*/sample2142.lab"
SHE
OVERPLAYED
HER
HAND
.
"*/sample2143.lab"
WHY
PUT
SUCH
A
HIGH
VALUE
ON
BEING
TOP
DOG
.
"*/sample2144.lab"
WHY
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
WORRY
ME
.
"*/sample2145.lab"
WAS
SHE
JUST
NATURALLY
SLOPPY
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
BUT
HER
PHYSICAL
APPEARANCE
.
"*/sample2146.lab"
BUT
IT
WAS
A
HOPEFUL
SIGN
HE
TOLD
HIMSELF
.
"*/sample2147.lab"
WHEN
THEY
GOT

AT
MIDNIGHT
SHE
WAS
TIRED
OUT

"*/sample2149.lab"
LET'S
BE

SAID
AS

WERE
JOKING

"*/sample2150.lab"
THEN
HE
FLED
NOT
WAITING
TO
SEE
IF
SHE
MINDED
HIM
OR
TOOK
NOTICE
OF
HIS
CRY
.
"*/sample2151.lab"
HE
SANK
BACK
SIGHING
AND
WAS
SOON
ASLEEP
AGAIN
.
"*/sample2152.lab"
HIS
FINGERS
FUMBLED
ACROSS
THE

.
"*/sample2153.lab"
HE
RECOGNIZED
HIS

.
"*/sample2154.lab"
SHE
MUST
HAVE
PUT
HIS

IN
THE

.
"*/sample2155.lab"
HE
WAS
KNEELING
TO
TIE
HIS

"*/sample2158.lab"
FOR
